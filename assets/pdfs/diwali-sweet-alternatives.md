## Tips for Success

### Blood Sugar Management:

1. **Test Before and After** - Check blood sugar 2 hours after eating to understand your body's response.

4. **Best Timing** - Afternoon (2-4 PM) is often best when insulin sensitivity is higher.

5. **Stay Active** - A 10-15 minute walk after eating helps glucose uptake.

### Storage Tips:

- **Ladoos:** Room temperature 1 week, refrigerate up to 3 weeks
- **Barfis:** Refrigerate up to 2 weeks
