## What is Pre-Diabetes?

Pre-diabetes is a warning sign—your blood sugar is higher than normal but not yet in the diabetic range. The good news? **Pre-diabetes is reversible** with the right diet and lifestyle changes.

### Pre-Diabetes Blood Sugar Ranges:
- **Fasting glucose:** 100-125 mg/dL
- **HbA1c:** 5.7% - 6.4%
- **Post-meal glucose:** 140-199 mg/dL

**This meal plan is specifically designed to:**
- ✅ Lower blood sugar naturally
- ✅ Improve insulin sensitivity
- ✅ Reduce belly fat (a key driver of insulin resistance)
- ✅ Use familiar, affordable Indian foods
- ✅ Be practical for busy Indian families
