# 7-Day Pre-Diabetes Reversal Meal Plan

**Your Action Plan to Bring Blood Sugar Back to Normal**

*By Health Gheware | Eat Well, Live Better - The Indian Way*

---

## What is Pre-Diabetes?

Pre-diabetes means your blood sugar is higher than normal but not yet diabetes:
- **Fasting glucose:** 100-125 mg/dL
- **HbA1c:** 5.7% - 6.4%
- **Post-meal glucose:** 140-199 mg/dL

**The Good News:** Pre-diabetes is **100% reversible** with the right food choices!

---

## How This Plan Works

This 7-day meal plan is specifically designed for **reversal**, not just management:

✅ **Low Glycemic Index (GI) foods** - Gentle on blood sugar  
✅ **High fiber combinations** - Slows glucose absorption  
✅ **Protein at every meal** - Prevents spikes  
✅ **Strategic meal timing** - Optimizes insulin sensitivity  
✅ **Indian ingredients** - Practical and familiar  

**Key Differences from Regular Diabetes Plans:**
- More aggressive carb reduction initially
- Focus on insulin sensitivity improvement
- Includes intermittent fasting elements (optional)
- Emphasizes reversal-specific superfoods
