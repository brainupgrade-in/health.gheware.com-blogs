# CGM Data Reading Cheat Sheet
## Your Complete Guide to Understanding Continuous Glucose Monitoring

---

## 📱 What is CGM and How It Works

### What is a CGM?
A **Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM)** is a small wearable device that tracks your blood sugar levels 24/7 without finger pricks. It consists of:

1. **Sensor** - A tiny filament inserted just under your skin (usually on arm or abdomen)
2. **Transmitter** - Sends data wirelessly to your phone or receiver
3. **Display** - Your smartphone app or dedicated reader showing real-time glucose

### How Does it Work?
- The sensor measures **interstitial fluid glucose** (not blood glucose)
- Readings are taken every **1-5 minutes** (varies by brand)
- There's typically a **5-15 minute lag** behind actual blood glucose
- Most sensors last **10-14 days** before replacement

### CGM vs Finger Prick
| Feature | CGM | Finger Prick |
|---------|-----|--------------|
| Readings | Every 1-5 min | On-demand |
| Pain | Initial insertion only | Every test |
| Trends | Yes (shows direction) | No |
| Night monitoring | Automatic | Requires waking up |
| Data history | Complete picture | Snapshots only |

## ⏱️ Understanding Time in Range (TIR)

### What is Time in Range?
TIR measures the **percentage of time** your glucose stays within your target range over a period (usually 7-14 days). It's one of the most important CGM metrics!

### Standard Target Ranges

| Category | Target Range | TIR Goal |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| **Type 1 & Type 2 Diabetes** | 70-180 mg/dL | >70% of time |
| **Prediabetes** | 70-140 mg/dL | >85% of time |
| **Gestational Diabetes** | 63-140 mg/dL | >85% of time |
| **Older Adults (>65 yrs)** | 70-200 mg/dL | >50% of time |

### TIR Goals Breakdown
For most diabetics, aim for:
- ✅ **Above Range (>180 mg/dL)**: <25% of time
- ✅ **In Range (70-180 mg/dL)**: >70% of time  
- ✅ **Below Range (<70 mg/dL)**: <4% of time
- ✅ **Very Low (<54 mg/dL)**: <1% of time

### Why TIR Matters
- Every **5% increase** in TIR reduces HbA1c by approximately **0.5%**
- Higher TIR = Lower risk of complications
- More useful than HbA1c alone because it shows variability

## 📊 Reading Glucose Patterns and Trends

### Trend Arrows Explained

| Arrow | Meaning | Glucose Change |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| ↑↑ | Rising rapidly | >3 mg/dL per minute |
| ↑ | Rising | 2-3 mg/dL per minute |
| → | Stable | <1 mg/dL per minute |
| ↓ | Falling | 2-3 mg/dL per minute |
| ↓↓ | Falling rapidly | >3 mg/dL per minute |

### Key Patterns to Watch

#### 1. **Dawn Phenomenon** 🌅
- **What**: Glucose rises early morning (4-8 AM) without eating
- **Why**: Liver releases glucose + hormones increase insulin resistance
- **Action**: Talk to doctor about medication timing; try protein-rich bedtime snack

#### 2. **Post-Meal Spikes** 🍽️
- **Normal**: Return to baseline within 2-3 hours
- **Problematic**: Stays elevated >3 hours or rises >50 mg/dL
- **Action**: Review carb portions, try walking after meals

#### 3. **Overnight Patterns** 🌙
- **Ideal**: Flat line between 90-120 mg/dL
- **Common issues**: Nocturnal hypoglycemia, late-night spikes from dinner
- **Action**: Adjust dinner timing, reduce evening carbs

#### 4. **Exercise Response** 🏃
- **During cardio**: Usually drops
- **During strength training**: May rise initially, then drop
- **Action**: Time exercise 1-2 hours after meals; keep glucose tabs handy

## 📈 What Spikes and Dips Mean

### Understanding Spikes (Hyperglycemia)

| Spike Level | Reading | Risk | Symptoms |
|-------------|---------|------|----------|
| **Mild** | 180-250 mg/dL | Low | May have none |
| **Moderate** | 250-400 mg/dL | Medium | Thirst, frequent urination |
| **Severe** | >400 mg/dL | HIGH | Confusion, nausea, vision issues |

#### Common Causes of Spikes
- 🍚 High-carb meals (especially refined carbs)
- 💊 Missed or insufficient medication/insulin
- 😰 Stress and illness
- 💤 Poor sleep
- ☕ Morning coffee on empty stomach
- 🍛 Large portions of rice/roti

### Understanding Dips (Hypoglycemia)

| Level | Reading | Severity | Action Needed |
|-------|---------|----------|---------------|
| **Level 1** | 54-70 mg/dL | Alert | Eat 15g fast carbs |
| **Level 2** | <54 mg/dL | Serious | Treat immediately |
| **Level 3** | Altered consciousness | Emergency | Glucagon/Call 102 |

#### Common Causes of Dips
- 💊 Too much insulin/medication
- 🏃 Unplanned exercise
- 🍽️ Skipped or delayed meals
- 🍺 Alcohol consumption
- ☀️ Hot weather

### The 15-15 Rule for Lows
1. Eat **15 grams** of fast-acting carbs
2. Wait **15 minutes**
3. Recheck glucose
4. Repeat if still <70 mg/dL

**15g Fast Carbs = 4 glucose tablets = 1/2 cup juice = 1 tbsp honey**

## 🎯 Optimal Ranges for Diabetics

### Time-Based Targets

| Time | Target Range | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| **Fasting (Morning)** | 80-130 mg/dL | Before breakfast |
| **Before Meals** | 80-130 mg/dL | Pre-prandial |
| **1-2 Hours After Meals** | <180 mg/dL | Post-prandial peak |
| **Bedtime** | 100-150 mg/dL | Before sleep |
| **Overnight** | 90-150 mg/dL | Avoid hypos |

### Variability Targets
- **Coefficient of Variation (CV)**: <36% is good
- **Standard Deviation**: Lower is better (indicates stability)
- **GMI (Glucose Management Indicator)**: Estimate of HbA1c from CGM data

### Indian Context Considerations 🇮🇳
- Post-meal targets may need to be stricter due to high-carb diets
- Monitor after dal-chawal, roti, rice dishes especially
- Festival periods (Diwali sweets, etc.) require extra attention

## 🙏 Tips for Success in India

### Food Strategies
- **Rice**: Limit to 1 small katori, pair with lots of vegetables
- **Roti**: Choose whole wheat, limit to 2 at a time
- **Dal**: Good choice! Protein helps slow glucose rise
- **Fruits**: Eat whole, not juiced; limit to 1 serving at a time
- **Sweets**: Save for small portions on special occasions

### Lifestyle Tips
- **10-minute walk** after meals significantly reduces spikes
- **Sleep 7-8 hours** — poor sleep increases insulin resistance
- **Manage stress** — cortisol raises blood sugar
- **Stay hydrated** — dehydration can affect CGM accuracy

### Sharing Data with Your Doctor
- Export reports from app before appointments
- Print or email 14-day/30-day ambulatory glucose profile (AGP)
- Highlight patterns you've noticed
- Ask about medication adjustments based on data
