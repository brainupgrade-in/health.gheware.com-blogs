Like Type 1, it involves autoimmune destruction of beta cells, but progression is slower. LADA accounts for 2-12% of adult-onset diabetes cases. Key features: positive for autoantibodies (especially GAD), doesn't require insulin for at least 6 months after diagnosis, and eventually requires insulin as beta cells decline."

Unlike Type 1, MODY is not autoimmune and doesn't require insulin at diagnosis. Unlike Type 2, it's not caused by obesity or lifestyle. MODY typically develops before age 25, runs strongly in families (50% of first-degree relatives inherit it), and there are at least 14 different genetic types. Treatment varies by type—some need no treatment, others respond to sulfonylureas."

After stopping steroids, up to a third of those who developed diabetes may have persistent diabetes. Other diabetes-causing medications include some immunosuppressants (tacrolimus, sirolimus), certain blood pressure medications, antipsychotics, and some HIV medications.

It's caused by damage to the pancreas from thick mucus buildup. CFRD is neither Type 1 nor Type 2—it has unique features of both. Treatment is almost always insulin.

C-peptide levels help distinguish LADA from Type 2 (LADA has lower levels that decline over time).

HNF1A-MODY (MODY 3, ~30-60% of cases) and HNF4A-MODY (MODY 1, ~5-10%): Respond excellently to low-dose sulfonylureas—often better than metformin or insulin.

GDM usually resolves after delivery, but 50% of women with GDM develop Type 2 diabetes within 5-10 years. It's managed with diet, exercise, and sometimes insulin. Steroid injections for fetal lung development can temporarily worsen blood sugar in 72-92% of pregnant women."

                <p><strong>When most people think of diabetes, they picture Type 1 or Type 2—but these aren't the only forms.</strong> Rare and secondary diabetes types affect millions worldwide, often going undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. LADA (Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults) accounts for 2-12% of adult-onset diabetes cases. MODY (Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young) represents 1-5% of all diabetes and is caused by specific genetic mutations. Type 3c diabetes develops from pancreatic damage and affects 1-9% of diabetic patients. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore these lesser-known diabetes types, their unique characteristics, and why getting the right diagnosis is crucial for proper treatment.</p>

            <h2 id="beyond-type1-type2">🔬 Beyond Type 1 and Type 2</h2>
            <p>The American Diabetes Association's 2024 Standards of Care recognizes four main categories of diabetes:</p>

            <ol style="line-height: 1.8; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
                <li><strong>Type 1 diabetes</strong> — Autoimmune destruction of beta cells (includes LADA)</li>
                <li><strong>Type 2 diabetes</strong> — Insulin resistance with progressive beta cell dysfunction</li>
                <li><strong>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)</strong> — Diabetes during pregnancy</li>
                <li><strong>Specific types due to other causes</strong> — Including MODY, Type 3c, drug-induced, and more</li>
            </ol>

            <p>This fourth category contains many distinct diabetes types, each with unique causes, characteristics, and treatment requirements. Understanding these differences is crucial because <strong>treatment that works for Type 2 may be ineffective or even harmful for other types</strong>.</p>

            <h2 id="lada">🧬 LADA: Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (Type 1.5)</h2>

            <!-- Definition Box -->
            <div style="background: #eff6ff; border-left: 4px solid #3b82f6; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;">
                <h4 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0; color: #1e40af;">📘 What is LADA?</h4>
                <p style="margin: 0;">LADA is an autoimmune form of diabetes that begins in adulthood and progresses slowly. Like Type 1, the immune system attacks insulin-producing beta cells. Unlike Type 1, this destruction happens gradually—patients don't need insulin for at least the first 6 months after diagnosis.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Prevalence</h3>
            <ul style="line-height: 1.8; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
                <li>LADA accounts for <strong>2-12% of all adult-onset diabetes</strong></li>
                <li>A study of 6,156 newly diagnosed adults found <strong>9.7% had LADA characteristics</strong></li>
                <li>LADA prevalence may actually be <strong>higher than Type 1 diabetes</strong></li>
                <li>Often misdiagnosed as Type 2 diabetes initially</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Diagnostic Criteria (Immunology for Diabetes Society)</h3>
            <ol style="line-height: 1.8; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
                <li><strong>Adult onset</strong> — Typically age 30-70 years</li>
                <li><strong>Positive for diabetes autoantibodies</strong> — GAD antibodies most common (68.6%); also IA-2A, ZnT8A</li>
                <li><strong>No insulin requirement</strong> — For at least 6 months after diagnosis</li>

            <h3>Unique Challenges</h3>
            <p>Type 3c presents distinct management challenges:</p>
            <ul style="line-height: 1.8; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
                <li><strong>Both highs AND lows:</strong> Damaged pancreas affects insulin AND glucagon, causing unpredictable blood sugar</li>
                <li><strong>Exocrine insufficiency:</strong> Many patients also have digestive problems (fatty stools, nutrient malabsorption)</li>
                <li><strong>Higher hypoglycemia risk:</strong> Patients may be more sensitive to insulin</li>
                <li><strong>Nutritional challenges:</strong> Malnutrition is common due to pancreatic enzyme deficiency</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- 50% Scroll Hook - Real Example -->
            <div style="background: #dcfce7; border-left: 4px solid #22c55e; padding: 1rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;">
                <strong>💚 Real Example:</strong> A colleague was diagnosed with "Type 2 diabetes" at age 38 despite being lean and active. After struggling with oral medications for 2 years, his doctor tested for autoantibodies - and discovered he actually had LADA. Switching to insulin dramatically improved his control. The lesson: if standard Type 2 treatment isn't working and you don't fit the typical profile, ask about autoantibody testing.

            <h2 id="drug-induced">💊 Drug-Induced Diabetes</h2>

            <p>Several medications can cause or worsen diabetes. Glucocorticoids (steroids) are the most common culprit.</p>

            <h3>Steroid-Induced Diabetes</h3>
            <ul style="line-height: 1.8; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
                <li><strong>&gt;10% of UK hospital inpatients</strong> receive glucocorticoids</li>
                <li>Steroids increase blood sugar through multiple mechanisms</li>
                <li><strong>Up to 1/3 of patients</strong> who develop steroid-induced diabetes have persistent diabetes after stopping steroids</li>
                <li><strong>Risk factors:</strong> Older age, higher BMI, elevated HbA1c, family history, personal history of gestational diabetes</li>

            <!-- Section 6: CFRD -->
            <h2 id="cfrd">🫁 Cystic Fibrosis-Related Diabetes (CFRD)</h2>

            <p>CFRD is a unique form of diabetes that develops in people with cystic fibrosis, caused by damage to the pancreas from thick mucus buildup.</p>

            <h3>Prevalence</h3>
            <ul style="line-height: 1.8; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
                <li><strong>2% of children</strong> with CF have CFRD</li>
                <li><strong>19-20% of adolescents</strong> with CF have CFRD</li>
                <li><strong>40-50% of adults</strong> with CF have CFRD</li>
                <li>CFRD is the <strong>most common comorbidity</strong> in cystic fibrosis</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <ul style="line-height: 1.8; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
                <li><strong>Not Type 1 or Type 2:</strong> CFRD has features of both but is distinct</li>
                <li><strong>Primarily insulin deficiency:</strong> Pancreatic damage reduces insulin production</li>
                <li><strong>Treatment:</strong> Almost always insulin (not oral medications)</li>
                <li><strong>Annual screening:</strong> Recommended from age 10 using oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Impact of CFTR Modulators</h3>
            <p>New treatments like Trikafta® are changing CFRD management:</p>
            <ul style="line-height: 1.8; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
                <li>People with CF are living longer—making CFRD more prevalent</li>
                <li>Modulators can <strong>improve HbA1c slightly</strong>, but CFRD doesn't resolve</li>
                <li>Weight gain from modulators may <strong>increase insulin resistance</strong></li>
                <li>GLP-1 medications now being considered for some CF patients (previously avoided due to weight loss)</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Section 7: PTDM -->
            <h2 id="ptdm">🏥 Post-Transplant Diabetes Mellitus (PTDM)</h2>

            <p>PTDM (formerly called NODAT—New-Onset Diabetes After Transplant) develops in people who receive organ transplants, primarily due to immunosuppressive medications.</p>

            <h3>Prevalence</h3>
            <ul style="line-height: 1.8; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
                <li><strong>Kidney transplant:</strong> 10-40% develop PTDM within 3 years</li>
                <li><strong>Liver transplant:</strong> 2.5-25%</li>
                <li><strong>Heart transplant:</strong> 4-40%</li>
                <li><strong>Lung transplant:</strong> 30-35%</li>
                <li><strong>76.5% of cases</strong> develop in the first 3 months post-transplant</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Risk Factors</h3>
            <ul style="line-height: 1.8; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
                <li><strong>Immunosuppressants:</strong> Tacrolimus is worse than cyclosporine for diabetes risk</li>
                <li><strong>Age:</strong> Older recipients at higher risk</li>
                <li><strong>Obesity:</strong> Pre-transplant BMI is a significant factor</li>
                <li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> Higher risk in Black and Hispanic populations</li>
                <li><strong>Family history:</strong> Pre-existing diabetes risk factors</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Management Challenges</h3>
            <p>PTDM requires balancing diabetes control with immunosuppression needs:</p>
            <ul style="line-height: 1.8; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
                <li>Can't simply stop immunosuppressants (risk of rejection)</li>
                <li>Some diabetes drugs may interact with transplant medications</li>
                <li>Lifestyle modifications and standard diabetes treatments are first-line</li>
                <li>The 2024 international consensus provides updated guidelines</li>
            </ul>

                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0; font-size: 1.1rem;">What is LADA (Type 1.5 diabetes)?</h3>
                    <p style="margin: 0; color: #4b5563;">LADA is an autoimmune diabetes that develops slowly in adults (typically after 30). It affects 2-12% of adult-onset diabetes. Like Type 1, it involves autoantibodies and eventual need for insulin, but progression is slower—no insulin needed for at least 6 months.</p>

                <div style="padding: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #e5e7eb;">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0; font-size: 1.1rem;">How is MODY different from Type 1 and Type 2?</h3>
                    <p style="margin: 0; color: #4b5563;">MODY is caused by single-gene mutations (not autoimmune like Type 1, not lifestyle-related like Type 2). It develops before age 25, runs in families (50% inheritance), and treatment varies by type—some need no treatment, others respond to sulfonylureas better than insulin.</p>

                <div style="padding: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #e5e7eb;">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0; font-size: 1.1rem;">What is Type 3c diabetes?</h3>
                    <p style="margin: 0; color: #4b5563;">Type 3c develops from pancreatic damage (chronic pancreatitis in 79% of cases, plus cancer, surgery, hemochromatosis, or CF). It affects 1-9% of diabetes cases. Unique feature: affects both insulin AND glucagon, causing unpredictable blood sugar with risk of both highs and lows.</p>

                <div style="padding: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #e5e7eb;">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0; font-size: 1.1rem;">Can medications cause diabetes?</h3>
                    <p style="margin: 0; color: #4b5563;">Yes. Steroids are the most common cause—>10% of hospital patients receive them. After stopping, up to 1/3 develop persistent diabetes. Other causes: tacrolimus (transplant drug), atypical antipsychotics, some HIV medications.</p>

                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0; font-size: 1.1rem;">What is CFRD and how common is it?</h3>
                    <p style="margin: 0; color: #4b5563;">CFRD (cystic fibrosis-related diabetes) affects 2% of CF children, 20% of adolescents, and 40-50% of adults with CF. It's the most common CF comorbidity. Treatment is almost always insulin. Annual screening starts at age 10.</p>

                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0; font-size: 1.1rem;">What is post-transplant diabetes (PTDM)?</h3>
                    <p style="margin: 0; color: #4b5563;">PTDM develops after organ transplants, affecting 10-40% of kidney recipients within 3 years. It's caused by immunosuppressants (especially tacrolimus) and other factors. 76.5% of cases occur in the first 3 months. Management balances diabetes control with rejection prevention.</p>

                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0; font-size: 1.1rem;">How do I know if I have a rare diabetes type?</h3>
                    <p style="margin: 0; color: #4b5563;">Consider testing if: diagnosed as Type 2 but not overweight and don't respond well to oral medications (possible LADA); strong family history with diabetes before age 25 (possible MODY); history of pancreatitis or pancreatic disease (possible Type 3c); recent organ transplant or steroid use (possible drug-induced).</p>

                <div style="padding: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #e5e7eb;">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0; font-size: 1.1rem;">Which MODY types don't need treatment?</h3>
                    <p style="margin: 0; color: #4b5563;">GCK-MODY (MODY 2), which represents 30-60% of MODY cases, usually doesn't need medication. It causes mild, stable fasting hyperglycemia that rarely leads to complications. Lifestyle management alone is usually sufficient. Genetic testing is essential to identify this type.</p>

                <div style="padding: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #e5e7eb;">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0; font-size: 1.1rem;">Why are rare diabetes types often misdiagnosed?</h3>
                    <p style="margin: 0; color: #4b5563;">Rare types mimic common types: LADA looks like Type 2 initially, MODY looks like Type 1 in young people. Specialized tests (autoantibodies, genetic testing) aren't routine. Many clinicians are unfamiliar with these types. Misdiagnosis leads to suboptimal treatment.</p>
                </div>
                <div style="padding: 1.5rem;">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0; font-size: 1.1rem;">Can gestational diabetes be considered a rare type?</h3>
                    <p style="margin: 0; color: #4b5563;">No—gestational diabetes affects 6-9% of pregnancies, making it common. However, it is a distinct type that develops during pregnancy and usually resolves after delivery. Importantly, 50% of women with GDM develop Type 2 within 5-10 years, so follow-up screening is essential.</p>
