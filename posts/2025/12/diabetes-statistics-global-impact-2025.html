The IDF Diabetes Atlas 11th Edition reveals the diabetes statistics 2025 has brought into stark focus: 589 million adults now live with this condition globally. But here's what keeps researchers up at night: <strong>these numbers are accelerating faster than anyone predicted.</strong></p>

            <p>The high undiagnosed rates in Africa and Asia mean that millions are developing preventable complications - heart disease, kidney failure, vision loss, and diabetic foot ulcers - without any awareness or treatment.</p>

            <h3>Why Undiagnosed Diabetes is Dangerous</h3>

            <p>Undiagnosed diabetes silently damages the body for years before symptoms become obvious:</p>

            <ul style="line-height: 1.9;">
                <li><strong>Cardiovascular damage:</strong> High glucose damages blood vessels, increasing heart attack and stroke risk</li>
                <li><strong>Kidney function decline:</strong> Diabetic nephropathy often progresses silently until late stages</li>
                <li><strong>Retinal damage:</strong> Diabetic retinopathy can cause irreversible vision loss</li>
                <li><strong>Nerve damage:</strong> Peripheral neuropathy leads to pain, numbness, and foot complications</li>
                <li><strong>Immune compromise:</strong> Higher infection risk and slower wound healing</li>
            </ul>

                <strong>💚 Real Example:</strong> When I was diagnosed in 2019, I learned I'd been part of that 43% undiagnosed population for an estimated 2-3 years. My fasting glucose was 287 mg/dL at diagnosis—but I'd had "borderline" readings of 105-120 mg/dL for years that nobody followed up on. By the time I was diagnosed, I already had early signs of retinopathy. These statistics aren't just numbers—each one represents someone whose life could have been different with earlier detection.

            <p><em>Priya's father had the same experience. His "routine checkup" glucose of 118 mg/dL was dismissed as "watch your diet." Three years later, his fasting glucose was 247 mg/dL - and his medical bills reflected it.</em></p>

            <ul style="line-height: 1.9;">
                <li><strong>Direct costs (74% in high-income countries):</strong> Hospitalizations, medications (insulin, oral drugs), outpatient care, lab tests, CGM devices, insulin pumps</li>

If even half of the 635 million people with prediabetes received lifestyle intervention, we could prevent 185 million new diabetes cases. The epidemic isn't inevitable; it's a policy choice.
