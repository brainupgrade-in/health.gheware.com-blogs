            <!-- Section 1: What Is a Keto Diet for Diabetes -->
            <h2 id="what-is-keto" style="color: #1e293b; margin-top: 3rem; padding-top: 1rem; border-top: 1px solid #e5e7eb;">🥑 What Is a Keto Diet for Diabetes?</h2>

            <p>A ketogenic diet is an eating pattern that dramatically reduces carbohydrate intake to shift your body's primary fuel source from glucose to ketones - a metabolic state called ketosis. For people with diabetes, this approach directly addresses the core issue: difficulty processing carbohydrates.</p>

            <!-- Definition Box -->
            <div style="background: #eff6ff; border-left: 4px solid #3b82f6; padding: 1.25rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;">
                <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>Ketogenic Diet:</strong> A very low-carbohydrate eating pattern that limits carbs to less than 26% of total calories (typically 20-50g of non-fiber carbs per day). This restriction induces ketosis, where the body burns fat for fuel instead of glucose. When followed consistently, keto can significantly reduce the glucose load on a diabetic's metabolic system.</p>
            </div>

            <h3 style="color: #374151;">How Keto Affects Blood Sugar</h3>

            <p>The relationship between carbohydrates and blood sugar is direct: when you eat carbs, they break down into glucose, which requires insulin to enter cells. For people with Type 2 diabetes (insulin resistance) or Type 1 diabetes (no insulin production), this process is impaired.</p>

            <p><strong>By drastically reducing carbohydrates:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Less glucose enters bloodstream:</strong> Fewer carbs = less glucose to manage</li>
                <li><strong>Reduced insulin demand:</strong> Lower glucose means less insulin needed</li>
                <li><strong>Improved insulin sensitivity:</strong> With less constant demand, cells may become more responsive to insulin</li>
                <li><strong>Stable blood sugar:</strong> Without carb-driven spikes, glucose levels remain more consistent</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 style="color: #374151;">The Science of Ketosis</h3>

            <p>When carb intake drops below roughly 50g per day:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Glycogen depletion:</strong> Your body uses up stored glucose (glycogen) in liver and muscles</li>
                <li><strong>Fat mobilization:</strong> Without glucose, body starts breaking down fat for energy</li>
                <li><strong>Ketone production:</strong> Liver converts fatty acids into ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, acetone)</li>
                <li><strong>Metabolic switch:</strong> Brain and body adapt to using ketones as primary fuel</li>
            </ol>

            <p>This metabolic state is fundamentally different from diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) - a dangerous condition with extremely high ketone and glucose levels. Nutritional ketosis involves much lower, controlled ketone levels.</p>

            <p>A <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9919384/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #3b82f6;">systematic review</a> comparing low-carb and ketogenic diets found:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ketogenic diets:</strong> -1.45% HbA1c reduction</li>
                <li><strong>Moderate low-carb:</strong> -0.27% HbA1c reduction</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The greater restriction in keto produces more significant glycemic improvements, but also requires more dietary discipline and medical monitoring.</p>

                <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>Indian Context:</strong> Traditional Indian diets are carb-heavy (rice, roti, dal). Transitioning to low-carb/keto means significant changes: replacing rice with cauliflower rice, using paneer and eggs as protein sources, and incorporating healthy fats like ghee, coconut oil, and nuts. Many Indian vegetables (palak, bhindi, lauki) are naturally low-carb.</p>

            <p>Despite its benefits, keto is not without risks - and it's not appropriate for everyone with diabetes.</p>

            <h3 style="color: #374151;">Key Risks</h3>

            <p><strong>1. Hypoglycemia (Low Blood Sugar)</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>If medications aren't reduced as carbs drop, blood sugar can go dangerously low</li>
                <li>Especially risky with insulin and sulfonylureas (glipizide, glyburide, glimepiride)</li>
                <li>Symptoms: shakiness, sweating, confusion, dizziness</li>
                <li><strong>Prevention:</strong> Work with doctor to preemptively adjust medications</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>2. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Different from nutritional ketosis - DKA involves dangerously high ketones AND glucose</li>
                <li>Higher risk with Type 1 diabetes, LADA, or SGLT2 inhibitor use</li>
                <li>Symptoms: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fruity breath, confusion</li>
                <li><strong>Emergency situation:</strong> Seek immediate medical care</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>3. Elevated LDL Cholesterol</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Some people see significant LDL increases on high-fat diets</li>
                <li>May be transient or persistent</li>
                <li>Consider lipid panel monitoring every 3-6 months</li>
                <li>Work with doctor if LDL rises significantly</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>4. "Keto Flu"</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Temporary symptoms in first 1-2 weeks: fatigue, headache, nausea, irritability</li>
                <li>Caused by electrolyte shifts and adaptation period</li>
                <li>Prevention: Stay hydrated, supplement sodium/potassium/magnesium</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>5. Nutrient Deficiencies</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Restricting food groups can lead to deficiencies without planning</li>
                <li>Common concerns: fiber, B vitamins, certain minerals</li>
                <li>Solution: Eat varied low-carb vegetables, consider multivitamin</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>6. Long-Term Adherence Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Research shows benefits often diminish at 6+ months as adherence drops</li>
                <li>Social situations, travel, and food availability can make keto difficult</li>
                <li>The "best diet" is one you can sustain</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you and your healthcare provider decide keto is appropriate for you, follow these steps for a safe transition:</p>

            <h3 style="color: #374151;">Step 1: Medical Clearance & Medication Plan</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Discuss with your doctor FIRST</strong> - this is non-negotiable</li>
                <li>Review all medications, especially insulin and sulfonylureas</li>
                <li>Get a medication reduction plan BEFORE starting (not after hypoglycemia occurs)</li>
                <li>Check if you're on SGLT2 inhibitors - may need to switch medications</li>
                <li>Get baseline labs: HbA1c, lipid panel, kidney function, electrolytes</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 style="color: #374151;">Step 2: Transition Gradually</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Week 1-2:</strong> Reduce carbs to 100-150g/day (moderate low-carb)</li>
                <li><strong>Week 3-4:</strong> Reduce to 50-100g/day</li>
                <li><strong>Week 5+:</strong> If desired, reduce to 20-50g/day (ketogenic)</li>
                <li>Gradual transition reduces "keto flu" and allows medication adjustments</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 style="color: #374151;">Step 3: Monitor Frequently</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Blood sugar:</strong> Check 4+ times daily initially (before meals and bedtime)</li>
                <li><strong>Ketones:</strong> Consider blood ketone meter for first few weeks</li>
                <li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Watch for hypoglycemia signs (shakiness, sweating, confusion)</li>
                <li><strong>Have fast-acting glucose available</strong> (glucose tablets, juice) for lows</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 style="color: #374151;">Step 4: Stay Hydrated & Manage Electrolytes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Drink 2-3 liters of water daily</li>
                <li>Add salt to food (sodium depletes on keto)</li>
                <li>Consider potassium and magnesium supplements</li>
                <li>Bone broth is a great electrolyte source</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 style="color: #374151;">Step 5: Follow Up Regularly</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Weekly:</strong> Check in with healthcare provider for first month</li>
                <li><strong>Monthly:</strong> Review progress and medication needs</li>
                <li><strong>Quarterly:</strong> Lab work (HbA1c, lipids, kidney function)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Here are answers to the most common questions about ketogenic and low-carb diets for diabetes:</p>

            <div style="background: #f9fafb; border-radius: 12px; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
                <h4 style="color: #1e293b; margin-top: 0;">Q: How quickly will I see blood sugar improvements on keto?</h4>
                <p style="color: #4b5563; margin-bottom: 0;">Many people see improvements within the first week as carb intake drops. However, this is precisely why medication adjustments are so important BEFORE starting. Significant HbA1c changes typically show on labs at 3 months. Full adaptation to ketosis takes 2-4 weeks.</p>
            </div>

            <div style="background: #f9fafb; border-radius: 12px; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
                <h4 style="color: #1e293b; margin-top: 0;">Q: Can I do keto with Type 1 diabetes?</h4>
                <p style="color: #4b5563; margin-bottom: 0;">It's possible but requires very close medical supervision due to DKA risk. A 2024 case study showed a Type 1 patient maintained 5.5% HbA1c and 90% Time in Range on keto for 10 years with 43% reduced insulin needs. However, this is not appropriate for everyone - work closely with your endocrinologist.</p>

                <h4 style="color: #1e293b; margin-top: 0;">Q: What if I can't sustain strict keto long-term?</h4>
                <p style="color: #4b5563; margin-bottom: 0;">That's common - adherence is the biggest challenge. Consider moderate low-carb (100-130g/day) as a sustainable middle ground. You'll still see benefits, just less dramatic than strict keto. The ADA recognizes multiple eating patterns as effective - choose what you can maintain.</p>

                <h4 style="color: #1e293b; margin-top: 0;">Q: Will I need to stay on keto forever?</h4>
                <p style="color: #4b5563; margin-bottom: 0;">Not necessarily. Some use keto to achieve remission, then transition to moderate low-carb or Mediterranean eating to maintain results. However, returning to high-carb eating typically reverses benefits. Diabetes is a chronic condition - some degree of carb awareness is usually helpful long-term.</p>

                <h4 style="color: #1e293b; margin-top: 0;">Q: Is keto safe for my kidneys?</h4>
                <p style="color: #4b5563; margin-bottom: 0;">For people with healthy kidneys, keto is generally safe. However, high protein intake (not a requirement of keto, but common) may stress kidneys with existing disease. Get kidney function tested before starting and monitor regularly. If you have diabetic nephropathy, discuss with your nephrologist.</p>
