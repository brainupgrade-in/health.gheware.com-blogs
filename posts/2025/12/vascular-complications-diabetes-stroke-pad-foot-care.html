                <p><strong>Vascular complications are the leading cause of death in people with diabetes, accounting for over 50% of all diabetes-related mortality.</strong> Diabetes damages blood vessels throughout your body, increasing stroke risk by 2-4 times and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) risk by up to 5 times. The consequences can be devastating: nearly half of patients over 65 who undergo diabetes-related amputation die within one year. But here's what offers hope&mdash;80% of amputations are preventable with proper care. This comprehensive guide covers the three major vascular complications: stroke, PAD, and diabetic foot disease, with evidence-based prevention strategies from the ADA 2025 guidelines.</p>

            <p>Diabetes damages blood vessels through multiple mechanisms. Chronic high blood sugar causes:</p>

            <ul style="line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                <li><strong>Atherosclerosis acceleration:</strong> Fatty plaque builds up in artery walls faster</li>
                <li><strong>Endothelial dysfunction:</strong> Blood vessel lining loses ability to relax and dilate</li>
                <li><strong>Oxidative stress:</strong> Free radicals damage vessel walls</li>
                <li><strong>Inflammation:</strong> Chronic low-grade inflammation promotes plaque formation</li>
                <li><strong>Platelet dysfunction:</strong> Increased tendency for blood clots</li>

            <h3 style="color: #374151; margin-top: 1.5rem;">Types of Stroke in Diabetes</h3>

            <p>Understanding the different types of stroke helps in both prevention and recognizing symptoms:</p>

            <ul style="line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                <li><strong>Ischemic stroke (87% of all strokes):</strong> A blood clot blocks an artery supplying the brain. Diabetes accelerates atherosclerosis that forms these clots. High blood sugar also makes blood "stickier" and more likely to clot.</li>
                <li><strong>Hemorrhagic stroke:</strong> A weakened blood vessel ruptures and bleeds into the brain. Diabetes damages vessel walls, making them fragile. Poorly controlled hypertension combined with diabetes significantly increases this risk.</li>
                <li><strong>Transient ischemic attack (TIA):</strong> Often called a "mini-stroke," TIA produces stroke-like symptoms that resolve within minutes to hours. TIAs are critical warning signs&mdash;25-30% of people who have a TIA will have a major stroke within 5 years.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 style="color: #374151; margin-top: 1.5rem;">Stroke Recovery in Diabetic Patients</h3>

            <p>Research shows that diabetic patients often have worse stroke outcomes compared to non-diabetic patients, making prevention even more critical:</p>

            <ul style="line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                <li><strong>Larger infarct size:</strong> Diabetic patients tend to have larger areas of brain damage due to impaired collateral blood flow</li>
                <li><strong>Higher mortality:</strong> In-hospital and 30-day mortality rates are elevated by approximately 25-30%</li>
                <li><strong>Slower recovery:</strong> Rehabilitation may take longer and be less complete; functional outcomes at 6 months are typically worse</li>
                <li><strong>Higher recurrence:</strong> Risk of second stroke is increased without aggressive risk factor management; diabetic patients have a 30% higher recurrence rate within 5 years</li>
                <li><strong>Hyperglycemia during stroke:</strong> High blood sugar at the time of stroke independently worsens outcomes, making glucose management during acute stroke critical</li>
            </ul>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 0; color: #1e3a5f;"><strong>Peripheral arterial disease (PAD)</strong> is atherosclerosis of the arteries supplying the limbs, most commonly the legs. Narrowed arteries reduce blood flow, causing pain, poor wound healing, and in severe cases, tissue death requiring amputation.</p>

                    <li>☐ <strong>Inspect feet daily</strong> - Check tops, bottoms, between toes (use mirror if needed)</li>
                    <li>☐ <strong>Look for:</strong> Cuts, blisters, redness, swelling, nail problems, calluses</li>
                    <li>☐ <strong>Wash feet daily</strong> - Warm (not hot) water; dry thoroughly, especially between toes</li>
                    <li>☐ <strong>Moisturize</strong> - Apply lotion to tops and bottoms, NOT between toes</li>
                    <li>☐ <strong>Trim nails carefully</strong> - Straight across, file edges; see podiatrist if difficult</li>
                    <li>☐ <strong>Never go barefoot</strong> - Always wear shoes or slippers, even indoors</li>
                    <li>☐ <strong>Check shoes before wearing</strong> - Feel inside for objects, rough spots</li>
                    <li>☐ <strong>Wear proper socks</strong> - Clean, dry, seamless; avoid tight bands</li>
                    <li>☐ <strong>Avoid extreme temperatures</strong> - No heating pads, hot water bottles on feet</li>
                    <li>☐ <strong>Don't self-treat</strong> - No "bathroom surgery" on corns/calluses</li>

            <ol style="line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                <li><strong>Offloading:</strong> Remove pressure from ulcer (special shoes, casts, crutches)</li>
                <li><strong>Debridement:</strong> Remove dead tissue to promote healing</li>
                <li><strong>Wound care:</strong> Appropriate dressings changed regularly</li>
                <li><strong>Infection control:</strong> Antibiotics if infected (50-60% of ulcers become infected)</li>
                <li><strong>Revascularization:</strong> If PAD present, restore blood flow</li>
                <li><strong>Glucose control:</strong> Optimize blood sugar for healing</li>
                <li><strong>Advanced therapies:</strong> Growth factors, skin substitutes, hyperbaric oxygen in select cases</li>

            <p>Vascular complications of diabetes disproportionately affect certain populations, revealing significant health disparities.</p>

            <h3 style="color: #374151; margin-top: 1.5rem;">2024 AHA Scientific Statement on PAD Disparities</h3>

            <ul style="line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                <li><strong>Black adults:</strong> 30% lifetime PAD risk vs. 19% for white adults; 4x higher amputation rates</li>
                <li><strong>Later diagnosis:</strong> PAD typically diagnosed at more advanced stage in Black patients</li>
                <li><strong>Native American populations:</strong> Highest overall amputation rates</li>
                <li><strong>Rural communities:</strong> Limited access to specialists, higher amputation rates</li>
                <li><strong>Low socioeconomic status:</strong> Associated with poorer outcomes across all groups</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The combination of diabetes and PAD leads to <strong>higher complication rates than either disease alone</strong>. Addressing these disparities requires improved access to preventive care, early screening, and specialist services.</p>

            <div style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                <h3 style="color: #374151; font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">How much does diabetes increase stroke risk?</h3>
                <p style="color: #4b5563; line-height: 1.7;">Diabetes increases stroke risk by 2 to 4 times. The ACCORD trial showed intensive blood pressure treatment reduced stroke by 41% in diabetic patients. Maintaining blood pressure below 130/80 mmHg is critical for stroke prevention.</p>
            </div>

            <div style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                <h3 style="color: #374151; font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">What is the mortality rate after diabetes-related amputation?</h3>
                <p style="color: #4b5563; line-height: 1.7;">Nearly 50% of patients over 65 die within one year of amputation due to PAD. The 5-year mortality rate is approximately 50%, exceeding many cancers. This underscores why prevention is critical.</p>
            </div>

            <div style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                <h3 style="color: #374151; font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Can diabetic foot ulcers be prevented?</h3>
                <p style="color: #4b5563; line-height: 1.7;">Yes! Up to 80% of diabetes-related amputations are preventable. Key strategies include daily foot inspection, proper footwear, good glucose control, regular podiatry visits, and immediate treatment of any foot injuries.</p>
            </div>

            <div style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                <h3 style="color: #374151; font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">How often should diabetic patients have foot exams?</h3>
                <p style="color: #4b5563; line-height: 1.7;">At minimum, a comprehensive foot exam annually by a healthcare provider. High-risk patients (history of ulcer, amputation, neuropathy, or PAD) should be examined every 1-3 months. Daily self-inspection is essential for everyone with diabetes.</p>
            </div>

            <div style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                <h3 style="color: #374151; font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">What are the first signs of PAD to watch for?</h3>
                <p style="color: #4b5563; line-height: 1.7;">Early PAD may be asymptomatic. The classic symptom is claudication&mdash;leg pain or cramping when walking that improves with rest. Other signs include cold feet, weak pulses, slow-healing wounds, and shiny or discolored leg skin.</p>
