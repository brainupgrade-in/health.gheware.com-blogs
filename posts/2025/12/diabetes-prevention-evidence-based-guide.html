The landmark Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) study proved that lifestyle changes can reduce diabetes risk by 58% in people with prediabetes.

The key interventions are 7% weight loss and 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week."

Yes, it can be reversed. A 2024 study in Nature Medicine showed that achieving prediabetes remission (returning to normal glucose levels) reduces diabetes risk by 76% over six years. This can happen even without significant weight loss if fat distribution shifts from visceral to subcutaneous deposits."

Clinical benefits begin at just 3% weight loss, but more aggressive goals (10-15%) provide even greater protection. The ADA 2025 guidelines recommend creating a 500-750 calorie daily deficit to achieve this sustainably."

Limit: refined carbohydrates (maida, white rice, white bread), sugary drinks, processed foods, and excessive red meat. The Mediterranean diet pattern has strong evidence for diabetes prevention."

However, metformin may be appropriate for high-risk individuals, especially those under 60 with BMI ≥35, women with prior gestational diabetes, or those unable to achieve lifestyle goals. Always discuss with your doctor—metformin for prevention is an off-label use."

The ICMR-INDIAB study found that 15.3% of the Indian population has prediabetes, compared to 11.4% with diabetes. This represents a massive prevention opportunity.

The DPP study found that participants aged 60 and older reduced their diabetes risk by 71%—compared to 58% for the overall group. This is likely because older adults often make more consistent lifestyle changes. It's never too late to start prevention efforts."

Key metrics to monitor: weight (weekly), physical activity (daily), fasting blood glucose (every 3-6 months), and HbA1c (annually). Apps like My Health Gheware help track glucose trends over time, correlate lifestyle factors with blood sugar, and provide AI insights on your patterns—giving you data-driven feedback on your prevention efforts."

                <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type 2 diabetes is 58% preventable:</strong> The DPP study proved lifestyle changes work better than medication</li>
                    <li><strong>7% weight loss is the magic number:</strong> For a 75 kg person, that's just 5.25 kg—modest but powerful</li>
                    <li><strong>150 minutes/week exercise:</strong> Even without weight loss, this alone reduces risk by 44%</li>
                    <li><strong>Age is an advantage:</strong> Adults 60+ saw 71% risk reduction—the highest of any group</li>
                    <li><strong>India has 136 million at risk:</strong> Prediabetes affects 15.3% of Indians—a massive prevention opportunity</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <!-- Opening Paragraph -->
            <p><strong>Type 2 diabetes is not inevitable—even if you have prediabetes or a strong family history.</strong> This isn't wishful thinking; it's what decades of rigorous scientific research have proven. The <a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/about-niddk/research-areas/diabetes/diabetes-prevention-program-dpp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)</a>, one of the largest clinical trials ever conducted, demonstrated that simple lifestyle changes can reduce your risk of developing Type 2 diabetes by 58%—and the benefits last for over 22 years.</p>

            <p>In India, where <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28601585/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">136 million people have prediabetes</a> according to the ICMR-INDIAB study, this is particularly relevant. If you're reading this because you've been told you're "at risk" or have "borderline diabetes," this guide will show you exactly what to do—backed by evidence, not hype.</p>

                <p>Before diving into strategies, let's understand why prevention is so crucial—and why it's more achievable than most people think.</p>

                <h3>The Scale of the Problem</h3>

                <p>Globally, <strong>537 million adults</strong> have diabetes, and this number is projected to reach 783 million by 2045. But here's what's often overlooked: for every person with diabetes, there are 2-3 people with prediabetes—a condition that usually has no symptoms but dramatically increases diabetes risk.</p>

                </div>

                <h3>Why Prevention Beats Treatment</h3>

                <p>Once Type 2 diabetes develops, it becomes a chronic condition requiring lifelong management. While excellent treatments exist, prevention offers something treatment cannot: avoiding the complications altogether.</p>

                <p><strong>Diabetes complications include:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cardiovascular disease:</strong> 2-4x higher heart attack and stroke risk</li>
                    <li><strong>Kidney disease:</strong> Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure</li>
                    <li><strong>Vision loss:</strong> Diabetic retinopathy can cause blindness</li>
                    <li><strong>Nerve damage:</strong> Neuropathy affects 50% of people with diabetes</li>
                    <li><strong>Amputations:</strong> Diabetes accounts for majority of non-traumatic amputations</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Prevention avoids all of these—while also avoiding the daily burden of medications, blood sugar monitoring, and dietary restrictions that come with diabetes management.</p>

                <div class="definition-box">
                    <h3>The Prevention Window</h3>
                    <p><strong>Prediabetes</strong> represents a critical window of opportunity. Blood sugar is elevated but not high enough for diabetes diagnosis. Without intervention, 15-30% of people with prediabetes will develop Type 2 diabetes within 5 years. With intervention, this can be reduced to less than 5%.</p>

                <h3>Long-Term Results (22-Year Follow-up)</h3>

                <p>What makes the DPP remarkable is the <a href="https://diabetes.org/newsroom/new-data-from-diabetes-prevention-program-outcomes-study-shows-persistent-reduction-of-t2d-development-over-22-year-average-follow-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener">persistence of benefits</a> over time:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>24% lower cumulative diabetes incidence</strong> in the lifestyle group vs placebo (22-year follow-up)</li>
                    <li><strong>3.5 years of additional diabetes-free life</strong> per person in the lifestyle group</li>
                    <li><strong>17% lower cumulative diabetes incidence</strong> in metformin group vs placebo</li>
                    <li><strong>2.5 years of additional diabetes-free life</strong> per person in metformin group</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The Most Powerful Finding: Age Advantage</h3>

                <p>Here's something that surprises many people: <strong>older adults benefited the most</strong> from lifestyle intervention.</p>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <h4>Age-Specific Risk Reduction</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Adults 60+:</strong> 71% diabetes risk reduction</li>
                        <li><strong>Adults 45-59:</strong> 58% reduction</li>
                        <li><strong>Adults 25-44:</strong> 48% reduction</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you're older and worried it's "too late," the evidence says the opposite—you have the most to gain from prevention efforts.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>What the Lifestyle Intervention Involved</h3>

                <p>The DPP lifestyle intervention had two specific, measurable goals:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Achieve and maintain 7% weight loss</strong> from baseline</li>
                    <li><strong>Complete 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity</strong> per week</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Participants received 16 individual sessions with a lifestyle coach over 24 weeks, followed by monthly contact. The program focused on behavior change—not just telling people what to do, but helping them actually do it.</p>

                <h3>The South Asian Factor</h3>

                <p>If you're of South Asian descent, you face elevated diabetes risk at lower BMI levels than other populations.

                <p><strong>Why the higher risk?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Greater tendency toward visceral (abdominal) fat accumulation</li>
                    <li>Higher insulin resistance at same BMI levels</li>
                    <li>Genetic susceptibility factors</li>

                <h2>4. The 7% Weight Loss Target</h2>

                <p>The DPP proved that modest weight loss—not dramatic transformation—is enough to significantly reduce diabetes risk. Let's break down exactly what this means and how to achieve it.</p>

                <h3>Why 7%?</h3>

                <p>According to the <a href="https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/48/Supplement_1/S167/157555/8-Obesity-and-Weight-Management-for-the-Prevention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ADA 2025 Standards of Care</a>, the 7% target was chosen because:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>It's achievable for most people</li>
                    <li>It provides significant metabolic benefits</li>
                    <li>It can be maintained long-term</li>
                    <li>Clinical benefits are progressive—more weight loss = more benefit</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What 7% Looks Like</h3>

                <h3>The Calorie Deficit Approach</h3>

                <p>To lose weight sustainably, the ADA recommends creating a <strong>500-750 calorie daily deficit</strong>. This translates to:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>0.5-0.75 kg weight loss per week</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>7% weight loss in approximately 3-4 months</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Ways to create a 500 calorie deficit:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduce portion sizes by 25%</li>
                    <li>Skip one sugary drink (150-200 calories) + one snack (150-200 calories)</li>
                    <li>Replace rice portion with vegetables (saves 200-300 calories)</li>
                    <li>Add 30 minutes of brisk walking (burns 150-200 calories)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Progressive Benefits of Weight Loss</h3>

                <p>Clinical benefits begin at just 3% weight loss and increase progressively:</p>

                <h2>5. 150 Minutes: The Exercise Prescription</h2>

                <p>Physical activity is the second pillar of diabetes prevention. Here's the evidence-based prescription and how to implement it.</p>

                <h3>The 150-Minute Target</h3>

                <p>The DPP target is <strong>150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week</strong>. This works out to:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>30 minutes, 5 days per week</li>
                    <li>OR 50 minutes, 3 days per week</li>
                    <li>OR any combination totaling 150 minutes</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The Power of Exercise Alone</h3>

                <p>Here's a finding that often gets overlooked: <strong>exercise alone reduces diabetes risk by 44%</strong>—even without reaching weight loss goals. In the DPP, participants who achieved the 150-minute exercise target but didn't lose 7% of their weight still had significantly lower diabetes rates than those who did neither.</p>

                <p>This means if you struggle with weight loss, focusing on physical activity is still highly effective.</p>

                <h3>Adding Resistance Training</h3>

                <p>The <a href="https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/48/Supplement_1/S50/157550/3-Prevention-or-Delay-of-Diabetes-and-Associated" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ADA 2025 guidelines</a> also recommend:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>2-3 sessions of resistance training per week</strong></li>
                    <li>Target all major muscle groups</li>
                    <li>8-10 exercises, 1-3 sets of 10-15 repetitions</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Resistance training improves insulin sensitivity independent of aerobic exercise and helps maintain muscle mass during weight loss.</p>

                <h3>Practical Exercise Strategies</h3>

                <p><strong>For beginners:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Start with 10 minutes of walking after meals</li>
                    <li>Increase by 5 minutes each week</li>
                    <li>Break it up: three 10-minute walks = one 30-minute walk</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>For busy schedules:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Walk during phone calls</li>
                    <li>Take stairs instead of lifts</li>
                    <li>Park further from destination</li>
                    <li>Stand or walk during meetings</li>

                <h2>7. Reversing Prediabetes: New Research</h2>

                <!-- 50% Scroll Hook - Real Example -->
                <div style="background: #f0fdf4; border-left: 4px solid #22c55e; padding: 1rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;">
                    <strong>🔬 Real Example:</strong> When Deepti received her prediabetes diagnosis (HbA1c 6.1%), she used My Health Gheware to track her patterns. She discovered that her morning upma was causing glucose spikes of 60+ mg/dL. By switching to oats with nuts and adding a 15-minute post-meal walk, she brought her HbA1c down to 5.5% within 4 months—achieving full remission.
                </div>

                <p>Recent research has revealed exciting new insights about prediabetes reversal—including that it may be possible even without significant weight loss.</p>

                <h3>The 76% Risk Reduction Finding</h3>

                <p>A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03944-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2025 study published in Nature Medicine</a> analyzed data from the Prediabetes Lifestyle Intervention Study (PLIS) and found:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>76% lower relative risk of diabetes</strong> in those who achieved both prediabetes remission AND ≥7% weight loss</li>
                    <li><strong>Prediabetes remission is more protective than weight loss alone</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Remission is possible without weight loss</strong>—if fat shifts from visceral to subcutaneous deposits</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="definition-box">
                    <h3>What is Prediabetes Remission?</h3>
                    <p><strong>Prediabetes remission</strong> means returning to normal glucose regulation (NGR)—HbA1c below 5.7% and fasting glucose below 100 mg/dL—without medication. This is a more stringent goal than simply avoiding diabetes diagnosis.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>The Mechanism</h3>

                <p>The study found that prediabetes remission involves:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Improved insulin sensitivity in muscle and liver</li>
                    <li>Better beta-cell function (insulin-producing cells)</li>
                    <li>Increased beta-cell sensitivity to GLP-1 (an important hormone)</li>
                    <li>Shift in fat distribution from visceral (around organs) to subcutaneous (under skin)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This explains why some people can reverse prediabetes even with minimal weight loss—what matters is WHERE fat is stored, not just total body weight.</p>

                <h3>How to Achieve Prediabetes Remission</h3>

                <p><strong>Step 1: Know your numbers</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Get HbA1c and fasting glucose tested</li>
                    <li>Prediabetes: HbA1c 5.7-6.4% or FBG 100-125 mg/dL</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Step 2: Implement DPP lifestyle changes</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>7% weight loss target</li>
                    <li>150 minutes moderate activity weekly</li>
                    <li>Reduce refined carbs, increase fiber</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Step 3: Monitor progress</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Retest HbA1c every 3 months initially</li>
                    <li>Track glucose trends (CGM or regular testing)</li>
                    <li>Measure waist circumference (visceral fat indicator)</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Step 4: Target remission</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Goal: HbA1c below 5.7%</li>
                    <li>Goal: Fasting glucose below 100 mg/dL</li>
                    <li>Maintain for at least 3 months without medication</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>8. Metformin and Other Medications</h2>

                <p>While lifestyle changes are more effective than medication, there's a role for pharmacotherapy in diabetes prevention for certain high-risk individuals.</p>

                <h3>Metformin for Prevention</h3>

                <p>The DPP showed metformin reduces diabetes risk by 31%—less than lifestyle intervention's 58%, but still significant.</p>

                <p><strong>Who should consider metformin for prevention?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Adults under 60 with BMI ≥35</li>
                    <li>Women with history of gestational diabetes</li>
                    <li>Those unable to achieve lifestyle goals despite effort</li>
                    <li>People with rapidly rising HbA1c despite lifestyle changes</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Important note:</strong> Metformin for diabetes prevention is an "off-label" use (not FDA-approved for this indication). It should only be considered after discussing with your healthcare provider.</p>

                <h3>GLP-1 Medications</h3>

                <p>Newer medications like semaglutide (Ozempic/Wegovy) have shown impressive weight loss and glucose-lowering effects. A <a href="https://www.hcplive.com/view/concurrent-lifestyle-intervention-enhances-semaglutide-weight-loss-xue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2025 study</a> found that combining semaglutide with lifestyle intervention enhances weight loss beyond medication alone.</p>

                <p>However, these medications are currently expensive and primarily indicated for weight management in those with BMI ≥30 (or ≥27 with comorbidities) or existing Type 2 diabetes—not for primary prevention in prediabetes.</p>

                <h3>The Bottom Line on Medications</h3>

                <p>For most people with prediabetes, lifestyle changes should be the first-line approach because:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>More effective (58% vs 31% risk reduction)</li>
                    <li>No side effects</li>
                    <li>Benefits extend beyond diabetes (cardiovascular, mental health, quality of life)</li>
                    <li>No medication costs</li>
                    <li>Sustainable long-term</li>

                    But here's what most people miss: You don't need to abandon traditional Indian food to prevent diabetes. The ICMR-INDIAB study showed that replacing just 25% of white rice with traditional millets (ragi, jowar, bajra) reduces post-meal glucose spikes by 20-30%—without eliminating rice entirely <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-024-03326-5" target="_blank" style="color: #1e40af;">[Source]</a>.
                </p>

                <p>India faces unique challenges in diabetes prevention—but also unique opportunities. Here's how to apply global evidence in the Indian context.</p>

                <h3>The Scale of Opportunity</h3>

                <p>According to the <a href="https://nmji.in/lessons-learnt-from-the-icmrindiab-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ICMR-INDIAB study</a>, India has:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>136 million people with prediabetes</strong>—the largest prevention opportunity globally</li>
                    <li><strong>28.6% with generalized obesity</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>39.5% with abdominal obesity</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>41.2% of adults 45+ at high diabetes risk</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p>If even a fraction of these 136 million people implement lifestyle changes, the impact on diabetes burden would be enormous.</p>

                <h3>Adapting the DPP for India</h3>

                <p><strong>Physical Activity Options:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Morning walks:</strong> Already culturally established in many areas</li>
                    <li><strong>Yoga:</strong> Effective for insulin sensitivity and stress reduction</li>
                    <li><strong>Dance:</strong> Zumba, Bollywood dance classes</li>
                    <li><strong>Walking groups:</strong> Social support improves adherence</li>
                    <li><strong>Active commuting:</strong> Cycling, walking part of commute</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Indian Diet Modifications:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Millets:</strong> Ragi, jowar, bajra—lower glycemic index than rice/wheat</li>
                    <li><strong>Traditional legumes:</strong> Dal daily provides protein and fiber</li>
                    <li><strong>Reduce rice portions:</strong> From 2 cups to 1 cup per meal</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoid refined oils:</strong> Use groundnut, mustard, or olive oil</li>
                    <li><strong>Limit sugar in chai:</strong> 3 cups with 2 tsp each = 30g sugar saved daily</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>State-Level Variation</h3>

                <p>Diabetes prevalence varies dramatically across India:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Highest:</strong> Goa (26.4%), Kerala, Punjab, Tamil Nadu</li>
                    <li><strong>Lowest:</strong> Uttar Pradesh (4.8%), Bihar, Jharkhand</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Urban areas consistently have higher rates than rural areas—though this gap is narrowing as rural India undergoes nutritional transition.</p>

                <h3>Government Programs</h3>

                <p>India has several national programs supporting diabetes prevention:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>National Programme for Prevention and Control of NCDs (NP-NCD):</strong> Screening and awareness</li>
                    <li><strong>Ayushman Bharat:</strong> Health and wellness centers for early detection</li>
                    <li><strong>Fit India Movement:</strong> Promoting physical activity</li>
                    <li><strong>Eat Right India:</strong> Nutritional awareness campaigns</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>AI-Powered Prevention Programs</h3>

                <p>A <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/newsroom/news-releases/2025/10/ai-powered-diabetes-prevention-program-shows-similar-benefits-to-those-led-by-people" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2025 study from Johns Hopkins</a> found that AI-powered diabetes prevention programs show similar benefits to human-led programs, with higher engagement:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>93.4% program initiation rate (vs 82.7% for human-led)</li>
                    <li>63.9% completion rate (vs 50.3% for human-led)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This is particularly relevant for India, where access to human lifestyle coaches may be limited outside major cities.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Can Type 2 diabetes be prevented?</h3>
                        <p>Yes, Type 2 diabetes can be prevented or significantly delayed in most cases. The landmark Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) study proved that lifestyle changes can reduce diabetes risk by 58% in people with prediabetes. Even 22 years later, participants who made lifestyle changes still had 24% lower diabetes rates than those who didn't. The key interventions are 7% weight loss and 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What is prediabetes and can it be reversed?</h3>
                        <p>Prediabetes is a condition where blood sugar levels are elevated but not high enough for a diabetes diagnosis (fasting glucose 100-125 mg/dL or HbA1c 5.7-6.4%). Yes, it can be reversed. A 2024 study in Nature Medicine showed that achieving prediabetes remission (returning to normal glucose levels) reduces diabetes risk by 76% over six years. This can happen even without significant weight loss if fat distribution shifts from visceral to subcutaneous deposits.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How much weight do I need to lose to prevent diabetes?</h3>
                        <p>The evidence-based target is 7% of your body weight. For a 75 kg person, that's about 5.25 kg. The DPP study showed this modest weight loss reduces diabetes risk by 58%. Clinical benefits begin at just 3% weight loss, but more aggressive goals (10-15%) provide even greater protection. The ADA 2025 guidelines recommend creating a 500-750 calorie daily deficit to achieve this sustainably.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How much exercise prevents diabetes?</h3>
                        <p>The recommended target is 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week—that's about 30 minutes, 5 days a week. The DPP found that even without reaching weight loss goals, achieving this exercise target alone reduced diabetes incidence by 44%. Moderate intensity means activities like brisk walking, cycling, or swimming where you can talk but not sing.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What foods help prevent diabetes?</h3>
                        <p>Focus on: whole grains (brown rice, oats, whole wheat), vegetables (especially leafy greens and non-starchy varieties), legumes (dal, rajma, chana), lean proteins (fish, chicken, paneer), and healthy fats (nuts, olive oil). Limit: refined carbohydrates (maida, white rice, white bread), sugary drinks, processed foods, and excessive red meat. The Mediterranean diet pattern has strong evidence for diabetes prevention.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Does metformin prevent diabetes?</h3>
                        <p>Yes, but lifestyle changes are more effective. The DPP study showed metformin reduced diabetes risk by 31% compared to 58% with lifestyle intervention. However, metformin may be appropriate for high-risk individuals, especially those under 60 with BMI ≥35, women with prior gestational diabetes, or those unable to achieve lifestyle goals. Always discuss with your doctor—metformin for prevention is an off-label use.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Who is at highest risk for Type 2 diabetes?</h3>
                        <p>High-risk factors include: prediabetes (HbA1c 5.7-6.4%), BMI ≥25 (≥23 for Asian Indians), family history of diabetes, age over 45, history of gestational diabetes, physical inactivity, high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and certain ethnicities (South Asians have higher risk at lower BMI). The Indian Diabetes Risk Score can help assess your personal risk level.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How common is prediabetes in India?</h3>
                        <p>India has approximately 136 million people with prediabetes—one of the highest numbers globally. The ICMR-INDIAB study found that 15.3% of the Indian population has prediabetes, compared to 11.4% with diabetes. This represents a massive prevention opportunity. With proper lifestyle intervention, many of these 136 million people can prevent progression to Type 2 diabetes.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Is diabetes prevention effective for older adults?</h3>
                        <p>Diabetes prevention is actually MORE effective for older adults. The DPP study found that participants aged 60 and older reduced their diabetes risk by 71%—compared to 58% for the overall group. This is likely because older adults often make more consistent lifestyle changes. It's never too late to start prevention efforts.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Can I track my diabetes prevention progress?</h3>
                        <p>Yes, tracking is crucial for successful prevention. Key metrics to monitor: weight (weekly), physical activity (daily), fasting blood glucose (every 3-6 months), and HbA1c (annually). Apps like My Health Gheware help track glucose trends over time, correlate lifestyle factors with blood sugar, and provide AI insights on your patterns—giving you data-driven feedback on your prevention efforts.</p>

                <h2>Taking Action: Your Prevention Plan</h2>

                <p>Type 2 diabetes is one of the most preventable chronic diseases. The science is clear—<strong>58% of cases can be prevented with lifestyle changes that are achievable for most people</strong>.</p>

                <p><strong>Your action plan:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Know your numbers:</strong> Get HbA1c and fasting glucose tested if you have any risk factors</li>
                    <li><strong>Set your weight goal:</strong> Calculate 7% of your current weight—this is your target</li>
                    <li><strong>Start moving:</strong> Begin with 10-minute walks after meals, build to 150 minutes/week</li>
                    <li><strong>Modify your diet:</strong> Make one change at a time—reduce portions, increase vegetables, limit sugar</li>
                    <li><strong>Track your progress:</strong> Monitor weight, activity, and blood glucose trends</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Remember: The DPP showed that the biggest benefits come from making consistent, sustainable changes—not dramatic transformations. Start where you are, use what you have, and do what you can.</p>
