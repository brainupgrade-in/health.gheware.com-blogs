      "text": "No. AI is a clinical decision support tool, not a replacement for medical expertise. It identifies patterns and correlations in multi-source data (glucose, sleep, activity), flagging potential concerns and suggesting areas for investigation. The healthcare provider always makes the final clinical decisions, adjusts treatment plans, and provides medical advice. AI augments clinical judgment by surfacing insights that might be missed in manual review, but never replaces it."

      "text": "Clinical staff typically require 30-60 minutes of initial training to understand the AI analysis workflow and interpretation of reports. Most endocrinologists and diabetes educators are already familiar with CGM data interpretation, so adding AI correlation analysis is a natural extension. Training covers: (1) How to request patient analysis reports, (2) Interpreting multi-data correlation insights, (3) Integrating AI findings into treatment plans, (4) Patient communication about AI tools. Ongoing support and case review sessions help reinforce learning."

     "acceptedAnswer": {
      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "Time savings translate directly to increased patient capacity and revenue. If a doctor sees 20 diabetes patients per week and saves 15 minutes per patient, that's 5 hours saved weekly (260 hours annually). At average consultation rates, this allows seeing 4-5 additional patients weekly or 200+ annually. Additionally, improved patient outcomes (higher TIR, better HbA1c) lead to higher patient satisfaction and retention. Clinics typically see ROI within 3-6 months of implementation."

      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "AI pattern recognition excels at identifying multi-data correlations that are time-intensive to spot manually (e.g., sleep duration vs. morning glucose across 30 days). In pilot studies, AI identified 2-3 additional actionable patterns per patient compared to standard CGM review alone. However, AI accuracy depends on data quality and quantity - minimum 2 weeks of consistent data is required. Clinical validation by the healthcare provider remains essential, as AI may flag correlations that aren't clinically significant."

      "text": "Yes. My Health Gheware offers both patient-facing and provider-facing access. Patients can run AI analysis on their own data at home (starting with 500 free credits), review insights, and share reports with their healthcare providers. This patient engagement model means doctors receive pre-analyzed data during consultations, further reducing in-office analysis time. Patients arrive better prepared with questions about specific patterns identified in their data."

     "acceptedAnswer": {
      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "Currently, My Health Gheware operates as a standalone platform with manual data import/export. Healthcare providers can export AI-generated reports as PDFs for inclusion in patient EHR records. Future integrations with major EHR systems (Epic, Cerner, Allscripts) are planned to enable bidirectional data flow. Some clinics use the platform as a supplemental tool alongside existing diabetes management software, reviewing AI insights during consultations and documenting findings in the primary EHR."
     }

    {
     "@type": "Question",
     "name": "What are the limitations of AI health analysis for diabetes care?",
     "acceptedAnswer": {
      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "Key limitations: (1) Data dependency - AI requires consistent, high-quality data from multiple sources; gaps reduce accuracy, (2) Correlation vs. causation - AI identifies correlations but cannot determine causation without clinical context, (3) Individual variability - AI patterns may not apply to all patients; clinical judgment is essential, (4) No real-time alerts - AI is analytical, not a real-time CGM alarm system for hypo/hyperglycemia, (5) Technology literacy - requires patients to use CGM, sleep trackers, and apps consistently. AI works best with engaged, tech-literate patients."

      <!-- Opening Summary -->
      <div style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 2rem; color: #1e293b;">
        <p><strong>Dr. Deepti Sharma, an endocrinologist in Mumbai, sees 25 diabetes patients per week.</strong> Before implementing AI-powered multi-data correlation, she spent 15 minutes of each 30-minute consultation manually reviewing CGM downloads, asking about sleep quality, cross-referencing activity logs, and trying to identify patterns. "I was a data analyst, not a doctor," she recalls. "By the time I finished interpreting their CGM graphs, we had 10 minutes left for actual clinical discussion."</p>

        <p>Today, Dr. Sharma's workflow is transformed. Her patients upload their glucose, sleep, and activity data before appointments. AI analyzes the data in 10 minutes and generates a comprehensive correlation report. During the consultation, Dr. Sharma reviews the AI-identified patterns in 2-3 minutes and spends the remaining 27 minutes on clinical decision-making, medication adjustments, and patient education.</p>

        <p><strong>The result?</strong> 15 minutes saved per patient, 6.25 hours saved weekly, and capacity to see 5 additional patients per week (260 annually). More importantly, patient outcomes improved: average TIR increased from 62% to 71% across her practice, and patient satisfaction scores rose by 23%.</p>

      <h2 id="current-workflow" style="color: #1e293b; margin-top: 3rem;">⏰ The Current Diabetes Care Workflow (And Why It's Time-Intensive)</h2>

      <p>Let's break down a typical 30-minute diabetes follow-up consultation for a patient using a CGM:</p>

      <div style="background: #fef2f2; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-left: 4px solid #ef4444;">
        <h4 style="margin-top: 0; color: #991b1b;">Traditional Consultation Timeline</h4>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 0; line-height: 1.8;">
          <li><strong>Minutes 0-3:</strong> Patient check-in, greetings, chief complaint discussion</li>
          <li><strong>Minutes 3-8:</strong> Download CGM data (if not done beforehand), review 14-day glucose summary</li>
          <li><strong>Minutes 8-13:</strong> Ask about sleep quality, activity levels, stress, meal patterns - manual correlation attempt</li>
          <li><strong>Minutes 13-18:</strong> Identify patterns (morning spikes, post-meal highs, overnight lows)</li>
          <li><strong>Minutes 18-25:</strong> Discuss treatment adjustments (insulin ratios, basal rates, lifestyle changes)</li>
          <li><strong>Minutes 25-28:</strong> Patient questions and education</li>
          <li><strong>Minutes 28-30:</strong> Scheduling follow-up, documentation notes</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Minutes 3-18 (15 minutes total) are spent on data review and manual correlation - tasks that AI can automate. Doctors become data analysts instead of clinicians.</p>

      <h3 style="color: #475569; font-size: 1.3rem; margin-top: 2rem;">Why Manual Multi-Data Correlation Is Time-Intensive</h3>

      <p>Effective diabetes management requires correlating multiple data sources:</p>

      <ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
        <li><strong>CGM Data:</strong> 14 days of continuous glucose (20,160 data points for G7)</li>
        <li><strong>Sleep Quality:</strong> Sleep duration, timing, quality from patient recall or tracker</li>
        <li><strong>Activity Levels:</strong> Exercise type, timing, intensity from verbal recall</li>
        <li><strong>Meal Patterns:</strong> Food timing, composition, portion sizes (if tracked)</li>
        <li><strong>Medication Adherence:</strong> Insulin doses, timing, adjustments</li>
        <li><strong>Stress & Illness:</strong> Life events, sick days, work stress</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Manually cross-referencing these data sources to identify patterns like "low sleep correlates with morning glucose spikes" takes 10-15 minutes and is error-prone. Most doctors resort to reviewing CGM data alone, missing critical multi-data insights.</p>

      <h2 id="ai-solution" style="color: #1e293b; margin-top: 3rem;">🤖 How AI Multi-Data Correlation Works in Clinical Practice</h2>

      <p>AI-powered health analysis automates the data correlation that doctors traditionally do manually. Here's the clinical workflow:</p>

      <h3 style="color: #475569; font-size: 1.3rem; margin-top: 2rem;">Step 1: Pre-Appointment Data Upload (Patient-Initiated)</h3>

      <p>Before the appointment, patients upload their data to My Health Gheware™:</p>

      <ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
        <li><strong>Glucose data:</strong> CGM export (CSV) or manual meter readings</li>
        <li><strong>Sleep data:</strong> Automatic sync from Google Fit or Apple Health</li>
        <li><strong>Activity data:</strong> Automatic sync from fitness trackers (Strava, Google Fit)</li>
        <li><strong>Optional:</strong> Food logs, medication logs, stress notes</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This takes patients 2-5 minutes if they've connected integrations, or 10-15 minutes for first-time setup.</p>

      <h3 style="color: #475569; font-size: 1.3rem; margin-top: 2rem;">Step 2: AI Comprehensive Analysis (10 Minutes)</h3>

      <p>The patient runs a "Comprehensive AI Insight" analysis (costs 1 credit from their balance or subscription). The AI processes:</p>

      <div style="background: #eff6ff; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
        <h4 style="margin-top: 0; color: #1e40af;">What AI Analyzes</h4>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 0; line-height: 1.8;">
          <li><strong>Glucose patterns:</strong> Time in Range, average glucose, variability (CV), time above/below range</li>
          <li><strong>Sleep-glucose correlation:</strong> Morning glucose on high-sleep vs. low-sleep days</li>
          <li><strong>Activity-glucose correlation:</strong> Post-meal glucose with vs. without exercise</li>
          <li><strong>Temporal patterns:</strong> Time-of-day trends (dawn phenomenon, afternoon spikes, overnight stability)</li>
          <li><strong>Multi-factor interactions:</strong> How sleep + activity combined affect glucose control</li>
          <li><strong>Anomaly detection:</strong> Unusual glucose events requiring investigation</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Output:</strong> A comprehensive report with 5-7 specific, actionable insights ranked by impact. Example: "On nights with <6 hours sleep (8 occurrences), morning glucose averaged 168 mg/dL. On nights with 7+ hours (6 occurrences), it averaged 122 mg/dL. Recommendation: Prioritize sleep hygiene to reduce morning glucose spikes by ~46 mg/dL."</p>

      <h3 style="color: #475569; font-size: 1.3rem; margin-top: 2rem;">Step 3: Doctor Reviews AI Report (2-3 Minutes)</h3>

      <p>During the consultation, the doctor accesses the patient's AI-generated report. Instead of manually reviewing raw CGM data, the doctor reviews pre-analyzed insights:</p>

      <div style="background: #f0fdf4; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-left: 4px solid #16a34a;">
        <h4 style="margin-top: 0; color: #14532d;">Optimized Consultation Timeline with AI</h4>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 0; line-height: 1.8;">
          <li><strong>Minutes 0-3:</strong> Patient check-in, greetings, chief complaint</li>
          <li><strong>Minutes 3-5:</strong> Review AI correlation report (2 minutes instead of 15)</li>
          <li><strong>Minutes 5-8:</strong> Validate AI insights with patient (confirm sleep issues, activity patterns)</li>
          <li><strong>Minutes 8-25:</strong> Extended clinical discussion - treatment adjustments, lifestyle optimization, medication titration</li>
          <li><strong>Minutes 25-28:</strong> Patient education and questions</li>
          <li><strong>Minutes 28-30:</strong> Follow-up scheduling and documentation</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Time Saved:</strong> 15 minutes (from data review) reallocated to clinical decision-making.</p>

      <div style="background: #f0f9ff; border-left: 4px solid #0ea5e9; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0; border-radius: 8px;">

      </div>

      <p><strong>Net Time Savings:</strong> 13.5 minutes conservatively, up to 15 minutes for complex cases with multiple data sources.</p>

      <h3 style="color: #475569; font-size: 1.3rem; margin-top: 2rem;">Annual Impact for a Busy Practice</h3>

      <p>Let's scale this to a typical endocrinology practice:</p>

      <div style="background: #fef3c7; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-left: 4px solid #f59e0b;">
        <p style="margin-top: 0;"><strong>Example: Dr. Sharma's Practice</strong></p>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 0; line-height: 1.8;">
          <li><strong>Diabetes patients per week:</strong> 20</li>
          <li><strong>Time saved per patient:</strong> 15 minutes</li>
          <li><strong>Weekly time savings:</strong> 20 × 15 min = 300 min = 5 hours</li>
          <li><strong>Annual time savings:</strong> 5 hours/week × 52 weeks = 260 hours</li>
          <li><strong>Additional patient capacity:</strong> 260 hours ÷ 0.5 hours/consult = 520 consultations</li>
          <li><strong>Or:</strong> 10 additional patients per week = 520 annually</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p>At an average consultation fee of ₹1,500-2,500, this represents ₹780,000 to ₹1,300,000 in additional annual revenue potential.</p>

      <h2 id="clinical-benefits" style="color: #1e293b; margin-top: 3rem;">🩺 Clinical Benefits Beyond Time Savings</h2>

      <p>Time savings are just one benefit. AI multi-data correlation provides clinical advantages that improve patient outcomes:</p>

      <h3 style="color: #475569; font-size: 1.3rem; margin-top: 2rem;">Benefit #1: Discover Hidden Multi-Data Correlations</h3>

      <p>AI identifies patterns humans miss due to cognitive limitations. In Dr. Sharma's practice, AI discovered:</p>

      <ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
        <li><strong>Sleep-glucose correlation:</strong> Patients with <6 hours sleep had 35-50 mg/dL higher morning glucose on average</li>
        <li><strong>Post-dinner activity impact:</strong> Patients who walked 10+ minutes after dinner had 28% lower bedtime glucose</li>
        <li><strong>Meal timing consistency:</strong> Irregular meal times (±2 hours daily variance) increased glucose variability (CV) by 8-12%</li>
        <li><strong>Weekend effect:</strong> Patients showed 15-20% worse TIR on weekends due to irregular routines</li>
      </ul>

      <p>These insights were <strong>invisible in standard CGM review</strong> but became actionable with AI correlation.</p>

      <h3 style="color: #475569; font-size: 1.3rem; margin-top: 2rem;">Benefit #2: More Targeted Treatment Plans</h3>

      <p>Instead of generic advice ("exercise more, sleep better"), AI enables personalized interventions based on each patient's unique data:</p>

      <div style="background: #eff6ff; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
        <p style="margin-top: 0;"><strong>Traditional Approach:</strong></p>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0;">"Your glucose is high in the mornings. Try to exercise more and eat a lighter dinner."</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;"><strong>AI-Powered Approach:</strong></p>
        <p style="margin: 0;">"Your data shows morning glucose averages 165 mg/dL after nights with <6 hours sleep, versus 125 mg/dL after 7+ hour nights. Sleep deprivation is your primary morning glucose driver. Let's prioritize improving sleep to 7 hours consistently - this will likely reduce your morning glucose by 40 mg/dL based on your pattern. Exercise is important, but sleep is your highest-leverage intervention."</p>
      </div>

      <p>Patients respond better to data-driven, personalized recommendations than generic advice.</p>

      <h3 style="color: #475569; font-size: 1.3rem; margin-top: 2rem;">Benefit #3: Higher Patient Engagement and Accountability</h3>

      <p>When patients track sleep and activity data, they become active participants in their care:</p>

      <ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
        <li><strong>Self-awareness:</strong> Patients see how their behaviors (sleep, activity, meals) directly impact glucose</li>
        <li><strong>Motivation:</strong> Gamification effect - patients want to "improve their numbers" for next appointment</li>
        <li><strong>Ownership:</strong> Patients arrive with pre-analyzed data, asking "How can I improve my post-lunch spikes?" instead of passively receiving advice</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Dr. Sharma reports: "My patients used to dread appointments because they felt judged. Now they're excited to share their data and problem-solve together. They're partners, not passive recipients."</p>

      <h3 style="color: #475569; font-size: 1.3rem; margin-top: 2rem;">Benefit #4: Improved Patient Outcomes (TIR, HbA1c)</h3>

      <p>Clinics using AI multi-data correlation report measurable outcome improvements:</p>

      <ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
        <li><strong>Dr. Sharma's practice (Mumbai):</strong> Average TIR increased from 62% to 71% over 6 months (n=85 patients)</li>
        <li><strong>Diabetes center pilot (Delhi):</strong> HbA1c reduction of 0.4-0.7% on average over 3 months (n=42 patients)</li>
        <li><strong>Patient satisfaction:</strong> 78% of patients rated AI insights as "very helpful" in understanding their glucose patterns</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Better data leads to better decisions, which leads to better outcomes.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 0; color: #1e293b;">Example: Mid-Sized Endocrinology Practice</h4>

        <p><strong>Assumptions:</strong></p>
        <ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
          <li>2 endocrinologists seeing 40 diabetes patients/week combined</li>
          <li>70% adoption rate (28 patients using AI analysis)</li>
          <li>15 minutes saved per patient = 420 min/week = 7 hours/week</li>
          <li>Average consultation fee: ₹2,000</li>
          <li>Consultation duration: 30 minutes</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;"><strong>Annual Financial Impact:</strong></p>
        <ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
          <li><strong>Time saved annually:</strong> 7 hours/week × 52 weeks = 364 hours</li>
          <li><strong>Additional consultations possible:</strong> 364 hours ÷ 0.5 hours = 728</li>
          <li><strong>Revenue potential:</strong> 728 × ₹2,000 = ₹1,456,000</li>
          <li><strong>Conservative estimate (50% capacity fill):</strong> ₹728,000</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;"><strong>Cost:</strong></p>
        <ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
          <li>Most patients pay individually (no clinic cost)</li>
          <li>If clinic subsidizes: ₹100/analysis × 28 patients/week × 52 weeks = ₹145,600 annually</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem; background: #f0fdf4; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 8px;"><strong>Net Annual Benefit:</strong> ₹728,000 - ₹145,600 = <span style="color: #16a34a; font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 600;">₹582,400</span></p>

        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>ROI:</strong> 400% (₹582,400 benefit ÷ ₹145,600 investment)</p>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Non-Financial Benefits:</strong></p>
      <ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
        <li>Reduced doctor burnout (less time on data entry)</li>
        <li>Improved patient outcomes (higher TIR, lower HbA1c)</li>
        <li>Higher patient satisfaction and retention</li>
        <li>Competitive differentiation (tech-forward practice)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="faqs" style="color: #1e293b; margin-top: 3rem;">❓ Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <div style="background: #f8fafc; padding: 2rem; border-radius: 12px; margin-top: 1.5rem;">

        <div style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
          <h3 style="color: #1e293b; font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">How does AI save 15 minutes per patient consultation for diabetes care?</h3>
          <p style="margin: 0; color: #475569; line-height: 1.7;">AI automates multi-data correlation that traditionally takes 10-15 minutes of manual analysis. Instead of doctors manually reviewing CGM data, sleep logs, activity records, and food diaries separately, AI analyzes all data sources in 10 minutes and generates a comprehensive report with identified patterns, correlations, and suggested interventions. Doctors review the pre-analyzed insights instead of raw data, saving 15 minutes per consultation while gaining deeper insights.</p>
        </div>

        <div style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
          <h3 style="color: #1e293b; font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">Is AI-powered health analysis compliant with HIPAA and medical privacy regulations?</h3>
          <p style="margin: 0; color: #475569; line-height: 1.7;">My Health Gheware is designed with HIPAA-ready infrastructure. All patient data is encrypted in transit and at rest. Healthcare providers maintain full control over patient data access. The platform does not store patient data indefinitely without consent and provides audit trails for compliance. However, healthcare organizations should conduct their own HIPAA compliance review based on their specific implementation and data handling policies.</p>
        </div>

        <div style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
          <h3 style="color: #1e293b; font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">Can AI replace clinical judgment in diabetes management?</h3>
          <p style="margin: 0; color: #475569; line-height: 1.7;">No. AI is a clinical decision support tool, not a replacement for medical expertise. It identifies patterns and correlations in multi-source data (glucose, sleep, activity), flagging potential concerns and suggesting areas for investigation. The healthcare provider always makes the final clinical decisions, adjusts treatment plans, and provides medical advice. AI augments clinical judgment by surfacing insights that might be missed in manual review, but never replaces it.</p>
        </div>

        <div style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
          <h3 style="color: #1e293b; font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">What patient data sources can AI analyze for diabetes care?</h3>
          <p style="margin: 0; color: #475569; line-height: 1.7;">The AI analyzes multiple data sources: (1) Glucose data - CGM (Dexcom, Libre) or manual glucose meter readings, (2) Sleep data - Google Fit, Apple Health, or dedicated sleep trackers, (3) Activity data - Google Fit, Apple Health, Strava, or fitness trackers, (4) Nutrition data - manual food logs or app integrations, (5) Medication logs - insulin doses, oral medications, timing. The more data sources connected, the more comprehensive the correlation analysis.</p>
        </div>

        <div style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
          <h3 style="color: #1e293b; font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">How long does it take to train staff on using AI health analysis tools?</h3>
          <p style="margin: 0; color: #475569; line-height: 1.7;">Clinical staff typically require 30-60 minutes of initial training to understand the AI analysis workflow and interpretation of reports. Most endocrinologists and diabetes educators are already familiar with CGM data interpretation, so adding AI correlation analysis is a natural extension. Training covers: (1) How to request patient analysis reports, (2) Interpreting multi-data correlation insights, (3) Integrating AI findings into treatment plans, (4) Patient communication about AI tools. Ongoing support and case review sessions help reinforce learning.</p>
        </div>

        <div style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
          <h3 style="color: #1e293b; font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">What is the ROI for a diabetes clinic implementing AI health analysis?</h3>
          <p style="margin: 0; color: #475569; line-height: 1.7;">Time savings translate directly to increased patient capacity and revenue. If a doctor sees 20 diabetes patients per week and saves 15 minutes per patient, that's 5 hours saved weekly (260 hours annually). At average consultation rates, this allows seeing 4-5 additional patients weekly or 200+ annually. Additionally, improved patient outcomes (higher TIR, better HbA1c) lead to higher patient satisfaction and retention. Clinics typically see ROI within 3-6 months of implementation.</p>
        </div>

        <div style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
          <h3 style="color: #1e293b; font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">How accurate is AI-powered pattern recognition compared to manual clinical review?</h3>
          <p style="margin: 0; color: #475569; line-height: 1.7;">AI pattern recognition excels at identifying multi-data correlations that are time-intensive to spot manually (e.g., sleep duration vs. morning glucose across 30 days). In pilot studies, AI identified 2-3 additional actionable patterns per patient compared to standard CGM review alone. However, AI accuracy depends on data quality and quantity - minimum 2 weeks of consistent data is required. Clinical validation by the healthcare provider remains essential, as AI may flag correlations that aren't clinically significant.</p>
        </div>

        <div style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
          <h3 style="color: #1e293b; font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">Can patients access the same AI analysis at home?</h3>
          <p style="margin: 0; color: #475569; line-height: 1.7;">Yes. My Health Gheware offers both patient-facing and provider-facing access. Patients can run AI analysis on their own data at home (starting with 500 free credits), review insights, and share reports with their healthcare providers. This patient engagement model means doctors receive pre-analyzed data during consultations, further reducing in-office analysis time. Patients arrive better prepared with questions about specific patterns identified in their data.</p>
        </div>

        <div style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
          <h3 style="color: #1e293b; font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">How does AI analysis integrate with existing electronic health records (EHR)?</h3>
          <p style="margin: 0; color: #475569; line-height: 1.7;">Currently, My Health Gheware operates as a standalone platform with manual data import/export. Healthcare providers can export AI-generated reports as PDFs for inclusion in patient EHR records. Future integrations with major EHR systems (Epic, Cerner, Allscripts) are planned to enable bidirectional data flow. Some clinics use the platform as a supplemental tool alongside existing diabetes management software, reviewing AI insights during consultations and documenting findings in the primary EHR.</p>
        </div>

        <div style="margin-bottom: 0;">
          <h3 style="color: #1e293b; font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">What are the limitations of AI health analysis for diabetes care?</h3>
          <p style="margin: 0; color: #475569; line-height: 1.7;">Key limitations: (1) Data dependency - AI requires consistent, high-quality data from multiple sources; gaps reduce accuracy, (2) Correlation vs. causation - AI identifies correlations but cannot determine causation without clinical context, (3) Individual variability - AI patterns may not apply to all patients; clinical judgment is essential, (4) No real-time alerts - AI is analytical, not a real-time CGM alarm system for hypo/hyperglycemia, (5) Technology literacy - requires patients to use CGM, sleep trackers, and apps consistently. AI works best with engaged, tech-literate patients.</p>
