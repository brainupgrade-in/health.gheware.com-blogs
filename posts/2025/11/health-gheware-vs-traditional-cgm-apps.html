Continue using your CGM manufacturer app (Dexcom G7, Freestyle Libre 3, etc.) for real-time glucose monitoring, alarms, and sensor management. Health Gheware adds the analytical layer: multi-data correlation, AI-powered insights, and pattern explanations that traditional CGM apps don't provide."

Export your glucose data from Dexcom Clarity, LibreView, or your CGM app as CSV/Excel, then import into Health Gheware in 60 seconds. Future updates will add direct API integrations with major CGM platforms for automatic syncing."

Health Gheware correlates glucose with sleep quality, physical activity, meal timing, stress levels, and medications to answer WHY patterns occur. AI provides 5-7 specific, actionable insights in 10 minutes instead of hours of manual analysis."

After 2-4 weeks when you have baseline data, add Health Gheware to discover deeper insights about how sleep, exercise, and meals affect YOUR specific glucose patterns. The combination provides both real-time safety and long-term optimization."

Health Gheware adds value if you: 1) Want to understand WHY patterns occur (not just WHAT), 2) Track multiple health factors (sleep, activity, food), 3) Need personalized insights beyond generic advice, 4) Value time saved (10-minute AI analysis vs hours of manual review). Start with ₹500 free credits to test if AI insights improve your control."

However, CGM provides 288 readings/day, giving AI much richer data for pattern recognition. Manual entry works for basic tracking, but CGM unlocks the full power of multi-factor correlation analysis. Many users start with manual entry, then upgrade to CGM after seeing initial insights."

Health Gheware is ₹1,490/month for unlimited AI insights, or pay-per-use (₹100/comprehensive insight). Total monthly cost: CGM hardware (₹3,000+) + Health Gheware (₹1,490 or pay-per-use) = ₹4,500-9,500/month for complete diabetes management with AI insights. Many users find 5-10% TIR improvement worth the incremental cost."

However, Health Gheware saves consultation time with pre-generated AI insights that explain patient patterns. Ideal workflow: Use CGM clinic dashboard for patient overview, then review Health Gheware AI reports for specific patients before appointments. This combination saves 10-15 minutes per patient consultation."

Use your CGM app for: 1) Real-time glucose monitoring and urgent alarms, 2) Sensor calibration and management, 3) Immediate safety checks. Use Health Gheware for: 1) Weekly pattern analysis and insights, 2) Understanding correlations with sleep/activity/meals, 3) Long-term optimization strategies.

AI excels at spotting correlations humans might miss (e.g., 'Friday night poor sleep correlates with Saturday morning highs'). However, medication adjustments, diagnosis, and treatment plans MUST come from your endocrinologist. Think of AI as a research assistant that prepares insights for your doctor to review and validate. Always verify AI recommendations with your healthcare provider."

            <h2 id="traditional-cgm">What Traditional CGM Apps Do Well</h2>
            <p>Before comparing, let's acknowledge where Dexcom G7, Freestyle Libre 3, and their companion apps excel:</p>

            <h3>1. Real-Time Glucose Monitoring (CGM Manufacturer Apps)</h3>
            <p><strong>What they offer:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Continuous glucose readings</strong> every 1-5 minutes (288 data points/day vs 4-6 finger pricks)</li>
                <li><strong>Live glucose trend arrows</strong> showing direction (↑ rising fast, → steady, ↓ dropping)</li>
                <li><strong>Current glucose value</strong> displayed on phone, watch, or dedicated receiver</li>
                <li><strong>Graph view</strong> showing last 1-24 hours of glucose history</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Real-time monitoring is critical for immediate safety. If your glucose drops to 65 mg/dL at 3 AM, you need an alarm NOW—not a weekly insight report.</p>

            <h3>2. Customizable Alarms and Alerts</h3>
            <p><strong>What they offer:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Low glucose alarms</strong> (e.g., alert when below 70 mg/dL)</li>
                <li><strong>High glucose alarms</strong> (e.g., alert when above 180 mg/dL)</li>
                <li><strong>Urgent low alarms</strong> (e.g., below 55 mg/dL—cannot be disabled)</li>
                <li><strong>Rate-of-change alerts</strong> (e.g., dropping >2 mg/dL per minute)</li>
                <li><strong>Lost signal alerts</strong> when sensor disconnects</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) can be life-threatening. Real-time alarms prevent medical emergencies.</p>

            <h3>3. Sensor Management Features</h3>
            <p><strong>What they offer:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sensor pairing</strong> via Bluetooth/NFC to phone</li>
                <li><strong>Sensor expiration tracking</strong> (10-14 day sensor life)</li>
                <li><strong>Calibration</strong> (for some CGM models requiring finger-prick verification)</li>
                <li><strong>Troubleshooting</strong> for sensor errors, connection issues</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> CGM hardware requires active management. Only manufacturer apps can handle sensor-specific functions.</p>

            <h3>4. Detailed Glucose-Only Reports (Companion Apps: Clarity, LibreView)</h3>
            <p><strong>What they offer:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ambulatory Glucose Profile (AGP)</strong>—the gold standard glucose report showing median glucose, variability, and time ranges</li>
                <li><strong>Time in Range (TIR) percentages</strong> broken down by day, week, month</li>
                <li><strong>Glucose patterns</strong> (morning highs, post-meal spikes, overnight lows)</li>
                <li><strong>Daily overlay charts</strong> showing glucose patterns by time of day</li>
                <li><strong>Shareable PDF reports</strong> for healthcare providers</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Endocrinologists rely on AGP reports to adjust medication. These companion apps generate clinic-quality reports for free.</p>

            <p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Traditional CGM apps are <em>essential</em> for diabetes management. They handle real-time safety, sensor operations, and comprehensive glucose reporting. <strong>Health Gheware doesn't replace these—it adds a layer they don't provide.</strong></p>

            <h2 id="health-gheware">What Health Gheware Adds (The Missing Layer)</h2>
            <p>My Health Gheware™ starts where traditional CGM apps end. It assumes you already have glucose data (from CGM or manual entry) and answers the questions CGM apps can't:</p>

            <h3>1. Multi-Data Correlation (Not Just Glucose)</h3>
            <p><strong>What Health Gheware adds:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Glucose + Sleep quality</strong> (via Google Fit/manual entry)—e.g., "6.2 hours sleep correlates with +18 mg/dL average glucose next day"</li>
                <li><strong>Glucose + Physical activity</strong> (via Strava/Google Fit)—e.g., "Morning walks reduce lunch spike by 22 mg/dL on average"</li>
                <li><strong>Glucose + Meal timing</strong> (manual logging)—e.g., "Eating dinner after 9 PM increases overnight glucose variability by 34%"</li>
                <li><strong>Glucose + Stress/medication</strong> (optional logging)—e.g., "Skipping metformin dose correlates with +45 mg/dL average"</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why traditional CGM apps can't do this:</strong> Dexcom and Libre apps only access glucose data from their sensors. They can't integrate sleep trackers, fitness apps, or food logs. Health Gheware connects all data sources to find correlations.</p>

            <h3>2. AI-Powered "WHY" Explanations</h3>
            <p><strong>What Health Gheware adds:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Root cause analysis</strong>—e.g., "Your Tuesday morning spikes (avg 195 mg/dL) correlate with Monday night sleep <6 hours (4 out of 5 Tuesdays)"</li>
                <li><strong>Multi-factor explanations</strong>—e.g., "Post-lunch spike to 220 mg/dL likely due to: 1) High-carb meal (estimated 75g), 2) Skipped morning exercise, 3) Poor sleep (5.8 hours) increasing insulin resistance"</li>
                <li><strong>Pattern confidence scoring</strong>—e.g., "85% confidence correlation between evening exercise and improved overnight TIR based on 21 days of data"</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why traditional CGM apps can't do this:</strong> CGM apps show glucose spikes but not WHY. You stare at a 220 mg/dL spike and wonder: "Was it the food? Sleep? Stress? All three?" AI analyzes all factors simultaneously to pinpoint causes.</p>

            <h3>3. Personalized, Actionable Insights (Not Generic Advice)</h3>
            <p><strong>What Health Gheware adds:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Specific to YOUR data</strong>—e.g., "Your optimal sleep duration is 7.5-8 hours (not the generic 7-9 hours) based on your glucose patterns"</li>
                <li><strong>Prioritized recommendations</strong>—e.g., "Top 3 actions to improve your 68% TIR: 1) Sleep 30 minutes earlier (expected +5-7% TIR), 2) Add 15-minute post-dinner walk (expected +3-5% TIR), 3) Reduce dinner carbs by 20g (expected +2-4% TIR)"</li>
                <li><strong>Expected impact estimates</strong>—e.g., "If you implement sleep improvement, expect to see TIR increase from 68% to 73-75% within 2 weeks based on similar patterns"</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why traditional CGM apps can't do this:</strong> CGM apps provide generic tips ("Exercise more", "Eat healthy"). Health Gheware analyzes YOUR unique patterns to say exactly WHAT to change and by HOW MUCH.</p>

            <h3>4. Time-Saving Automated Analysis (10 Minutes vs Hours)</h3>
            <p><strong>What Health Gheware adds:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Comprehensive AI report in 10 minutes</strong> covering 2-4 weeks of multi-data correlation</li>
                <li><strong>5-7 specific insights</strong> ranked by impact potential (highest TIR improvement first)</li>
                <li><strong>Visual correlation charts</strong> showing sleep vs glucose, activity vs glucose, meal timing vs glucose</li>
                <li><strong>Shareable PDF reports</strong> for doctor appointments (saves explaining patterns verbally)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why traditional CGM apps can't do this:</strong> Manually cross-referencing glucose data with sleep logs, activity tracker, and food diary takes hours. Health Gheware automates this with AI in 10 minutes.</p>

            <p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Health Gheware doesn't compete with CGM apps—it completes them. Use Dexcom/Libre for real-time safety. Use Clarity/LibreView for glucose reports. Add Health Gheware when you want to understand WHY patterns occur and WHAT to do about it.</p>

                <strong>💚 Real Example:</strong> Rajesh was frustrated with his Dexcom Clarity reports. They showed his TIR stuck at 68% for months, with clear morning spikes—but zero explanation of why. "I tried everything my app suggested: adjusting basal rates, changing meal times, exercising more. Nothing worked." When he connected his Google Fit sleep data to Health Gheware, the AI revealed something Clarity couldn't see: his morning spikes correlated 0.87 with nights he woke between 2-4 AM. "It wasn't my medication or food—it was fragmented sleep triggering cortisol spikes. Once I addressed sleep quality, my TIR jumped to 76% in three weeks."

            <h3>ROI Analysis: Is Health Gheware Worth ₹1,490/Month?</h3>
            <p>Let's calculate value based on Time in Range improvement:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Scenario:</strong> You currently have 68% TIR (baseline with CGM app only)</li>
                <li><strong>Target improvement:</strong> +8-12% TIR with Health Gheware insights (sleep optimization, meal timing, activity correlation)</li>
                <li><strong>Expected TIR after 8 weeks:</strong> 76-80% TIR</li>
                <li><strong>Health benefit:</strong> Every 10% TIR improvement reduces HbA1c by ~0.5% and lowers long-term complication risk by 15-20%</li>
                <li><strong>Cost of TIR improvement:</strong> ₹1,490/month ÷ 10% TIR gain = ₹149 per 1% TIR improvement</li>
                <li><strong>Alternative cost:</strong> Hiring a diabetes coach or nutritionist = ₹5,000-10,000/month for similar personalized insights</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> If you can improve TIR by 8-12% for ₹1,490/month, Health Gheware costs 70-85% less than hiring a human coach while providing 24/7 AI analysis. ROI is positive if you value avoiding long-term complications (retinopathy, neuropathy, kidney disease).</p>

            <p><strong>Free Trial Strategy:</strong> Start with ₹500 free credits (5 comprehensive insights). If first insight identifies one actionable pattern (e.g., "Poor sleep causes your morning highs"), test the recommendation for 2 weeks. If TIR improves 3-5%, subscription pays for itself.</p>

                <strong>🔄 But here's what most people miss:</strong> The best diabetes management tool isn't the most feature-rich one—it's the combination you'll actually use consistently. A 2024 adherence study found that patients using 2-3 complementary tools (CGM app + lifestyle tracker + AI insights) achieved 23% better outcomes than those with premium all-in-one solutions they only checked sporadically. Simple, focused tools used daily beat sophisticated tools used weekly.

            </div>

            <h2 id="use-cases">Which Tool for Which User Type?</h2>
            <p>Here's a decision framework based on your diabetes management maturity:</p>

            <h3>Newly Diagnosed (0-6 months): CGM App Only</h3>
            <p><strong>Recommended tools:</strong> Dexcom G7 or Freestyle Libre 3 app only</p>
            <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> You're learning diabetes basics—how food, exercise, and medication affect glucose. Focus on real-time monitoring, understanding alarms, and recognizing patterns. Avoid information overload from AI insights before you grasp fundamentals.</p>
            <p><strong>When to add Health Gheware:</strong> After 2-4 weeks when you have baseline data and understand basic glucose patterns.</p>

            <h3>Intermediate Users (6-12 months): CGM + Companion App</h3>
            <p><strong>Recommended tools:</strong> Dexcom G7 + Dexcom Clarity (or Libre + LibreView)</p>
            <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> You've mastered real-time monitoring. Now you need detailed reports to share with your endocrinologist. AGP reports from Clarity/LibreView help doctors adjust medication dosages.</p>
            <p><strong>When to add Health Gheware:</strong> If you're stuck at 60-70% TIR and want to optimize beyond medication adjustments. If you wonder WHY certain patterns occur despite following general advice.</p>

            <h3>Advanced Optimizers (12+ months): CGM + Companion + Health Gheware</h3>
            <p><strong>Recommended tools:</strong> Full stack (Dexcom G7 + Clarity + Health Gheware)</p>
            <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> You've plateaued at 70-75% TIR. Generic advice ("eat healthy", "exercise more") doesn't move the needle. You need personalized insights: "YOUR optimal sleep duration is 7.5 hours" or "YOUR post-lunch spikes correlate with skipping morning walks on Tuesdays."</p>
            <p><strong>Expected outcome:</strong> Achieve 80-85% TIR with multi-factor optimization (sleep + activity + meal timing + medication).</p>

            <h3>Healthcare Professionals (Endocrinologists, Diabetes Educators)</h3>
            <p><strong>Recommended tools:</strong> Clarity Pro/LibreView Pro (for clinic dashboards) + Health Gheware (for pre-generated patient insights)</p>
            <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Clarity Pro provides multi-patient overview dashboards. Health Gheware saves consultation time by pre-analyzing patient data. Instead of spending 15 minutes reviewing graphs, read AI insights in 2 minutes and focus on treatment plan.</p>
            <p><strong>Workflow:</strong> Patient imports data to Health Gheware → AI generates insights → Patient shares PDF with doctor → Doctor reviews insights before appointment → 10-15 minutes saved per consultation.</p>

            <h3>Budget-Conscious Users: CGM + Health Gheware Pay-Per-Use</h3>
            <p><strong>Recommended tools:</strong> Freestyle Libre 3 (₹3,000-4,000/month sensors) + Health Gheware pay-per-use (₹100/insight, 2-4 insights/month = ₹200-400/month)</p>
            <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Libre sensors are cheaper than Dexcom. Pay-per-use avoids subscription commitment. Run AI insights weekly or bi-weekly instead of daily.</p>
            <p><strong>Total cost:</strong> ₹3,200-4,400/month for CGM + AI insights (vs ₹8,990/month for Dexcom + Health Gheware subscription).</p>

            <h2 id="together">Using Both Tools Together: Recommended Workflow</h2>
            <p>Here's how to integrate Health Gheware with your existing CGM setup for maximum benefit:</p>

            <h3>Daily Workflow</h3>
            <ol>

                <li><strong>Respond to alarms immediately</strong> (treat lows with fast-acting carbs, highs with medication/exercise per doctor's instructions)</li>
                <li><strong>Log additional data</strong> in Health Gheware: sleep hours (auto-sync Google Fit), exercise (auto-sync Strava), meals (manual entry with carb estimates)</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Weekly Workflow</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Export glucose data from CGM app</strong> (every Sunday evening)</li>
                <li><strong>Import to Health Gheware</strong> (60-second CSV upload)</li>
                <li><strong>Run comprehensive AI analysis</strong> (10 minutes to generate 5-7 insights)</li>
                <li><strong>Review top 3 insights</strong> (prioritize highest-impact recommendations)</li>
                <li><strong>Implement 1-2 changes</strong> for the upcoming week (e.g., "Sleep 30 minutes earlier" or "Add post-dinner walk")</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Monthly Workflow</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Generate AGP report from Clarity/LibreView</strong> (glucose-only comprehensive report)</li>
                <li><strong>Generate AI insights PDF from Health Gheware</strong> (multi-factor correlation report)</li>
                <li><strong>Combine both reports</strong> for doctor appointment</li>
                <li><strong>Discuss with endocrinologist:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>AGP report for medication adjustments</li>
                        <li>Health Gheware insights for lifestyle optimization</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Update treatment plan</strong> based on both data sources</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Example Combined Workflow (Real-World Scenario)</h3>
            <p><strong>Monday Morning (7 AM):</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Dexcom app shows glucose = 145 mg/dL (slightly high)</li>
                <li>Check Health Gheware insight from last week: "Poor sleep correlates with +18 mg/dL morning glucose"</li>
                <li>Check Google Fit: Only slept 6.2 hours last night → explains high reading</li>
                <li>Action: Take morning medication, go for 15-minute walk to bring glucose down</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Sunday Evening (Weekly Review):</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Dexcom Clarity shows 72% TIR this week (up from 68% last week)</li>
                <li>Health Gheware AI insight: "Your TIR improved because you slept 7.5+ hours on 5 out of 7 nights (vs 3 out of 7 last week)"</li>
                <li>Conclusion: Sleep improvement working → continue prioritizing 7.5-8 hours sleep</li>
                <li>Next optimization: Health Gheware recommends "Add post-lunch walk to reduce afternoon spikes"</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Monthly Doctor Visit:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Show Dexcom Clarity AGP report: TIR improved from 68% → 74% over 4 weeks</li>
                <li>Show Health Gheware AI insights: Sleep optimization contributed +4-5% TIR, meal timing +2-3% TIR</li>
                <li>Doctor validates insights, adjusts medication slightly, praises lifestyle changes</li>
                <li>Plan: Continue current approach, aim for 80% TIR next month</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="decision">Decision Framework: Is Health Gheware Right for You?</h2>
            <p>Answer these 5 questions to decide if you should add Health Gheware to your diabetes management toolkit:</p>

            <h3>Question 1: Are You Stuck at 60-75% TIR Despite Following General Advice?</h3>
            <p><strong>If YES:</strong> Health Gheware likely adds value. You need personalized insights beyond generic tips.</p>
            <p><strong>If NO (TIR < 60% or > 80%):</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>If TIR < 60%: Focus on medication optimization with your doctor first (Health Gheware can help but isn't primary solution)</li>
                <li>If TIR > 80%: You're already optimized—may not need AI insights unless pursuing 90%+ TIR</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Question 2: Do You Track Sleep, Exercise, or Meals Regularly?</h3>
            <p><strong>If YES:</strong> Health Gheware maximizes value from existing data. AI correlates what you're already tracking.</p>
            <p><strong>If NO:</strong> Start tracking for 2 weeks first. If you won't log additional data, Health Gheware's multi-factor correlation can't work (garbage in = garbage out).</p>

            <h3>Question 3: Do You Want to Understand WHY Patterns Occur (Not Just WHAT)?</h3>
            <p><strong>If YES:</strong> Health Gheware's core strength. AI explains causation, not just correlation.</p>
            <p><strong>If NO:</strong> Stick with Clarity/LibreView. They show WHAT happened (TIR, patterns, trends) without WHY explanations.</p>

            <h3>Question 4: Is ₹1,490/Month Worth 8-12% TIR Improvement to You?</h3>
            <p><strong>If YES:</strong> ROI is positive. Subscription pays for itself via better glucose control.</p>
            <p><strong>If NO:</strong> Try pay-per-use (₹100/insight, 2-4/month = ₹200-400/month) or skip Health Gheware entirely.</p>

            <h3>Question 5: Are You Willing to Implement AI Recommendations?</h3>
            <p><strong>If YES:</strong> Health Gheware works best for action-takers who test insights (e.g., "Sleep 30 minutes earlier for 2 weeks and measure impact").</p>
            <p><strong>If NO:</strong> Don't pay for insights you won't implement. Stick with free CGM apps.</p>

            <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <h3>Can I use Health Gheware with Dexcom G7 or Freestyle Libre 3?</h3>
            <p>Yes! Health Gheware works with all major CGM systems. Export your glucose data from Dexcom Clarity, LibreView, or your CGM app as CSV/Excel, then import into Health Gheware in 60 seconds. Future updates will add direct API integrations with major CGM platforms for automatic syncing.</p>

            <h3>Does Health Gheware replace my Dexcom or Freestyle Libre app?</h3>
            <p>No, Health Gheware is a companion tool, not a replacement. Continue using your CGM manufacturer app (Dexcom G7, Freestyle Libre 3, etc.) for real-time glucose monitoring, alarms, and sensor management. Health Gheware adds the analytical layer: multi-data correlation, AI-powered insights, and pattern explanations that traditional CGM apps don't provide.</p>

            <h3>What makes Health Gheware different from Dexcom Clarity or LibreView?</h3>
            <p>The key difference is multi-data correlation. Dexcom Clarity and LibreView excel at glucose-only analysis (TIR, patterns, reports). Health Gheware correlates glucose with sleep quality, physical activity, meal timing, stress levels, and medications to answer WHY patterns occur. AI provides 5-7 specific, actionable insights in 10 minutes instead of hours of manual analysis.</p>

            <h3>Which tool is better for newly diagnosed diabetes patients?</h3>
            <p>Start with your CGM manufacturer app (Dexcom, Libre) to master glucose monitoring basics: understanding TIR, recognizing patterns, managing alarms. After 2-4 weeks when you have baseline data, add Health Gheware to discover deeper insights about how sleep, exercise, and meals affect YOUR specific glucose patterns. The combination provides both real-time safety and long-term optimization.</p>

            <h3>Is Health Gheware worth the cost compared to free CGM apps?</h3>
            <p>Value depends on your needs. If you're satisfied with basic glucose tracking and TIR reports, stick with free CGM apps. Health Gheware adds value if you: 1) Want to understand WHY patterns occur (not just WHAT), 2) Track multiple health factors (sleep, activity, food), 3) Need personalized insights beyond generic advice, 4) Value time saved (10-minute AI analysis vs hours of manual review). Start with ₹500 free credits to test if AI insights improve your control.</p>

            <h3>Can Health Gheware work without a continuous glucose monitor?</h3>
            <p>Yes, but with limitations. You can manually log finger-prick glucose readings (4-6 times daily). However, CGM provides 288 readings/day, giving AI much richer data for pattern recognition. Manual entry works for basic tracking, but CGM unlocks the full power of multi-factor correlation analysis. Many users start with manual entry, then upgrade to CGM after seeing initial insights.</p>

            <h3>How does Health Gheware pricing compare to CGM subscription costs?</h3>
            <p>CGM hardware (sensors) costs ₹3,000-8,000/month depending on brand. CGM apps (Clarity, LibreView) are free. Health Gheware is ₹1,490/month for unlimited AI insights, or pay-per-use (₹100/comprehensive insight). Total monthly cost: CGM hardware (₹3,000+) + Health Gheware (₹1,490 or pay-per-use) = ₹4,500-9,500/month for complete diabetes management with AI insights. Many users find 5-10% TIR improvement worth the incremental cost.</p>

            <h3>Can I use both Health Gheware and my CGM app simultaneously?</h3>
            <p>Yes, and this is the recommended approach! Use your CGM app for: 1) Real-time glucose monitoring and urgent alarms, 2) Sensor calibration and management, 3) Immediate safety checks. Use Health Gheware for: 1) Weekly pattern analysis and insights, 2) Understanding correlations with sleep/activity/meals, 3) Long-term optimization strategies. They serve complementary purposes: CGM app for daily safety, Health Gheware for strategic improvement.</p>

            <h3>How accurate is Health Gheware's AI compared to endocrinologist recommendations?</h3>
            <p>Health Gheware AI analyzes YOUR data patterns—it doesn't replace your doctor's expertise. AI excels at spotting correlations humans might miss (e.g., "Friday night poor sleep correlates with Saturday morning highs"). However, medication adjustments, diagnosis, and treatment plans MUST come from your endocrinologist. Think of AI as a research assistant that prepares insights for your doctor to review and validate. Always verify AI recommendations with your healthcare provider.</p>

            <h3>Which tool is better for healthcare professionals managing multiple patients?</h3>
            <p>Traditional CGM apps (Clarity Pro, LibreView Pro) offer better multi-patient dashboards and clinic-focused features. However, Health Gheware saves consultation time with pre-generated AI insights that explain patient patterns. Ideal workflow: Use CGM clinic dashboard for patient overview, then review Health Gheware AI reports for specific patients before appointments. This combination saves 10-15 minutes per patient consultation.</p>
