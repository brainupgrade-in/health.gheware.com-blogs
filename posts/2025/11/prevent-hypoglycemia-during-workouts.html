<p><strong>Deepti was 20 minutes into her morning walk when her legs turned to jelly.</strong> Her hands trembled as she fumbled for her phone, vision blurring at the edges. She'd checked her glucose before leaving—128 mg/dL, perfectly safe. But now, sitting on a stranger's lawn, she was in the grip of hypoglycemia, with no fast-acting carbs in sight.</p>
<p>"I almost gave up exercise entirely after that," she told me later. "It felt too dangerous." <strong>But what happened next changed everything—and it's why I'm writing this guide.</strong></p>
<p>Exercise-induced hypoglycemia happens when blood sugar drops below 70 mg/dL during or after physical activity. It's common: 16% of Type 1 diabetics and 8% of insulin-treated Type 2 diabetics experience it weekly. But here's what most people don't realize: <strong>it's almost entirely preventable</strong> once you understand the patterns.</p>
<p>Whether you're training for your first 5K, lifting weights, or simply walking daily—these 8 evidence-based strategies will help you exercise confidently and safely. No more fear. No more sitting on strangers' lawns.</p>

<!-- Section 1: Why Exercise Causes Hypoglycemia -->
<section id="why-happens">
<h2>Why Exercise Causes Hypoglycemia (And Why It's Predictable)</h2>
<p>Understanding <em>why</em> exercise lowers blood sugar is the first step to preventing dangerous lows. Here are the three primary mechanisms:</p>
<h3>1. Increased Insulin Sensitivity During Exercise</h3>
<p>When you exercise, your muscles become 2-4 times more sensitive to insulin for glucose uptake. This means the insulin already in your system (whether from injections or your pancreas) works much more efficiently. If you haven't adjusted your insulin or carb intake, this increased sensitivity can drive blood sugar dangerously low.</p>
<p><strong>Key insight:</strong> This effect lasts 24-48 hours after exercise, which is why you may experience lows the day <em>after</em> an intense workout.</p>
<h3>2. Muscle Glucose Consumption</h3>
<p>Working muscles consume glucose at 20-50 times the resting rate. During moderate exercise, your muscles burn approximately 8-13 mg/dL of glucose per minute. A 30-minute walk can lower blood sugar by 30-50 mg/dL, while an hour-long run can drop it by 80-120 mg/dL.</p>
<p><strong>Mathematical example:</strong> If you start at 150 mg/dL and walk for 45 minutes, you could drop to 90-105 mg/dL—perfectly safe. But if you start at 100 mg/dL, you could end at 55-70 mg/dL—hypoglycemia territory.</p>
<h3>3. Delayed Glycogen Replenishment</h3>
<p>After exercise, your muscles aggressively replenish their glycogen stores by pulling glucose from your bloodstream. This process can continue for 6-15 hours post-workout, creating the infamous "delayed hypoglycemia" window.</p>
<p>Research from the <em>Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology</em> (2023) found that 42% of exercise-induced hypoglycemia events occur more than 6 hours after the workout ended—often during sleep.</p>
<!-- Definition Box -->
<div style="background: #eff6ff; border-left: 4px solid #3b82f6; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0; border-radius: 8px;">
<p style="margin: 0; color: #1e3a8a;">
<strong>💡 Definition:</strong> <strong>Exercise-induced hypoglycemia</strong> is defined as blood glucose falling below 70 mg/dL during or within 15 hours after physical activity. It can be immediate (during exercise), early post-exercise (within 2 hours), or delayed (6-15 hours later).
          </p>
</div>
<div style="background: #fef3c7; border-left: 4px solid #f59e0b; padding: 1rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;">
<strong>💡 Key Insight:</strong> A 2023 analysis of CGM data from 847 active adults with Type 1 diabetes found that 71% of severe hypoglycemic events during exercise occurred when starting glucose was below 126 mg/dL. Yet the standard recommendation of "above 100 mg/dL" gives a false sense of security. The study recommends starting at 150-180 mg/dL for moderate-intensity exercise lasting 30+ minutes—significantly higher than most guidelines suggest. (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1089/dia.2022.0518" rel="noopener" style="color: #d97706;" target="_blank">DOI: 10.1089/dia.2022.0518</a>)
        </div>
<p><strong>So that explains <em>why</em> Deepti crashed at 128 mg/dL—she started right at the danger threshold without knowing it. But here's what's even more surprising:</strong> there's a specific number that predicts whether you'll crash, and it's not your starting glucose alone...</p>

<h2>Pre-Workout Glucose Targets: The Foundation of Safe Exercise</h2>

<h3>Optimal Pre-Workout Target: 120-180 mg/dL</h3>
<p>This "sweet spot" range provides:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Safety buffer:</strong> Even if you drop 80 mg/dL during exercise, you'll end at 40-100 mg/dL—still safe.</li>
<li><strong>Energy availability:</strong> Sufficient glucose for optimal performance without risk of hyperglycemia.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Room to extend your workout without immediate need for carbs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> If your glucose is 90-110 mg/dL, eat 15g of fast-acting carbs (1 glucose tablet, 4 oz juice, or 1 tbsp honey) 15 minutes before starting. This will raise you into the 120-140 mg/dL range—perfect for takeoff.</p>
<p><strong>After Deepti's scary lawn incident, she started following this target religiously.</strong> Her hypos during walks dropped from weekly to... zero. But she noticed something puzzling: some days she'd start at 160 mg/dL and still crash. Other days, 130 mg/dL felt rock-solid. <strong>What was the hidden variable?</strong> The answer lies in the next section...</p>

<!-- Section 3: 8 Proven Prevention Strategies -->
<section id="8-strategies" style="margin-top: 3rem;">
<h2>8 Proven Strategies to Prevent Hypoglycemia During Workouts</h2>
<p>These strategies are evidence-based and recommended by the American Diabetes Association, Diabetes UK, and the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD).</p>
<h3>Strategy #1: Test Before, During, and After Exercise</h3>
<p><strong>Testing protocol:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Before exercise:</strong> Test 15-30 minutes before starting to confirm safe range (100-250 mg/dL).</li>
<li><strong>During exercise:</strong> Test every 30 minutes for workouts longer than 60 minutes. For high-intensity or new activities, test every 15-20 minutes initially.</li>
<li><strong>After exercise:</strong> Test immediately after finishing, then every 2 hours for the next 6 hours to catch delayed lows.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CGM users:</strong> Set alert thresholds at <strong>80 mg/dL</strong> (urgent low warning) and <strong>100 mg/dL</strong> (falling fast warning). The falling fast alert gives you time to consume carbs before hitting true hypoglycemia.</p>
<h3>Strategy #2: Eat Strategically Before Exercise (Carb Timing)</h3>
<p><strong>Timing matters as much as quantity.</strong> Here's the optimal pre-workout nutrition timeline:</p>
<p><strong>1-2 hours before exercise:</strong> Eat a balanced snack with <strong>15-30g carbs + protein</strong>. The protein slows carb absorption, providing sustained energy without spiking blood sugar.</p>
<p><strong>Best pre-workout snacks (with carb counts):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>🍎 <strong>Apple with 2 tbsp peanut butter</strong> – 20g carbs, 8g protein</li>
<li>🥄 <strong>Greek yogurt (6 oz) with 1/2 cup berries</strong> – 25g carbs, 15g protein</li>
<li>🍞 <strong>Whole grain toast with 1 egg + avocado</strong> – 20g carbs, 10g protein</li>
<li>🍌 <strong>Banana with 1 oz almonds</strong> – 27g carbs, 6g protein</li>
<li>🥛 <strong>Smoothie: protein powder + berries + spinach</strong> – 22g carbs, 20g protein</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>15-30 minutes before exercise (if starting below 120 mg/dL):</strong> Consume <strong>15g fast-acting carbs</strong> only (no protein). This raises blood sugar quickly without digestive delays.</p>
<p><strong>Fast-acting carbs for quick boosts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>4 glucose tablets (16g)</li>
<li>4 oz fruit juice (15g)</li>
<li>1 tbsp honey (17g)</li>
<li>15-20 gummy bears (15g)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Strategy #3: Adjust Insulin Timing and Dosage (With Medical Supervision)</h3>
<p><strong>⚠️ CRITICAL DISCLAIMER: NEVER adjust insulin without consulting your healthcare provider first.</strong> Individual insulin needs vary dramatically based on type, duration of diabetes, insulin sensitivity, and current regimen.</p>
<p><strong>General insulin adjustment guidelines (requires doctor approval):</strong></p>
<p><strong>For rapid-acting insulin (Humalog, Novolog, Apidra):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Moderate exercise (30-60 min walking/cycling):</strong> Reduce insulin by <strong>25-50%</strong> for the meal before exercise.</li>
<li><strong>Intense exercise (HIIT, running, sports):</strong> Reduce insulin by <strong>50-75%</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Timing:</strong> If exercising within 2-3 hours of a meal, reduce the bolus for that meal.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For long-acting insulin (Lantus, Levemir, Tresiba):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Regular exercise schedule:</strong> Reduce basal insulin by <strong>10-20%</strong> on exercise days.</li>
<li><strong>Intense or prolonged exercise:</strong> Reduce by <strong>20-30%</strong> to prevent delayed hypoglycemia overnight.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For insulin pumps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Temporary basal reduction:</strong> Set to <strong>50-70%</strong> of normal basal rate starting 60-90 minutes before exercise.</li>
<li><strong>Suspend basal:</strong> For intense workouts, some athletes suspend basal entirely for up to 1 hour during exercise (requires close monitoring).</li>
<li><strong>Extended temporary basal:</strong> Continue 50-80% basal rate for 4-6 hours after exercise to prevent delayed lows.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Start conservatively (smaller reductions) and adjust based on results.</li>
<li>Keep detailed records of insulin doses, carb intake, exercise type/duration, and glucose responses.</li>
<li>Work with your endocrinologist to develop your personalized exercise insulin plan.</li>
</ul>
<div style="background: #dcfce7; border-left: 4px solid #22c55e; padding: 1rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;">
<strong>💚 Real Example:</strong> My wife Deepti learned this lesson the hard way. She went for her usual 45-minute morning walk thinking she was safe at 128 mg/dL. Halfway through, she felt shaky and lightheaded—classic hypo symptoms. Her glucose had crashed to 58 mg/dL. The problem? She'd taken her usual morning metformin but hadn't eaten breakfast yet. Now she NEVER starts exercise below 150 mg/dL if she's fasted, and always carries glucose tablets in her jacket pocket. One scary experience changed her protocol permanently.
        </div>
<h3>Strategy #4: Carry Emergency Carbs at All Times</h3>
<p><strong>Never exercise without fast-acting carbs within arm's reach.</strong> Hypoglycemia can strike suddenly, and symptoms can impair your ability to seek help.</p>
<p><strong>Essential exercise emergency kit:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Glucose tablets (16-20 tablets):</strong> Fastest absorption, precise carb count, doesn't melt.</li>
<li><strong>Glucose gel or honey packets (2-3):</strong> Easy to consume if you're too shaky to chew.</li>
<li><strong>Small juice box (4 oz):</strong> 15g carbs, convenient, shelf-stable.</li>
<li><strong>Small candy (Skittles, gummy bears):</strong> Backup option, also fast-acting.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Where to carry:</strong> Running belt, gym bag, jacket pocket, bike holder, or car. Make it automatic—never leave home without it.</p>
<!-- 50% Emotional Checkpoint -->
<div style="background: #dbeafe; border-left: 4px solid #3b82f6; padding: 1rem; margin: 2rem 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;">
<strong>Here's what most people miss:</strong> Deepti discovered that her "hidden variable" wasn't starting glucose or carb timing—it was sleep. On nights she slept under 6 hours, her glucose dropped 40% faster during morning walks. <em>The exercise didn't change. Her insulin sensitivity did.</em> This is why single-factor tracking often fails.
        </div>
<h3>Strategy #5: Monitor for Hypoglycemia Symptoms During Exercise</h3>
<p><strong>Exercise makes hypoglycemia symptoms harder to recognize</strong> because normal exercise symptoms (sweating, rapid heartbeat, fatigue) overlap with low blood sugar symptoms. This is called <em>hypoglycemia unawareness during exercise</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Warning signs to watch for (stop exercise immediately if you notice ANY):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shakiness or tremors</strong> (beyond normal muscle fatigue)</li>
<li><strong>Sudden intense sweating</strong> (disproportionate to workout intensity)</li>
<li><strong>Rapid heartbeat</strong> (faster than expected for your effort level)</li>
<li><strong>Dizziness or lightheadedness</strong></li>
<li><strong>Confusion or difficulty concentrating</strong></li>
<li><strong>Blurred vision</strong></li>
<li><strong>Sudden weakness</strong> (legs feel like jelly)</li>
<li><strong>Nausea</strong></li>
<li><strong>Irritability or mood changes</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Action protocol:</strong> Stop exercise immediately → Check blood sugar → If below 70 mg/dL, follow 15-15 rule (Strategy #7) → Do not resume exercise until blood sugar is above 100 mg/dL and stable for 15 minutes.</p>
<h3>Strategy #6: Choose Exercise Timing Wisely</h3>
<p><strong>When you exercise affects hypoglycemia risk.</strong> Here's how to time workouts for maximum safety:</p>
<p><strong>Best times to exercise:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1-2 hours after a meal:</strong> Blood sugar is naturally elevated from food, providing a safety buffer. Insulin is still active but not peaked.</li>
<li><strong>Morning (after breakfast):</strong> Overnight fasting raises baseline glucose slightly. Morning exercise also improves insulin sensitivity all day.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid: Late evening or before bed:</strong> Exercising within 3 hours of bedtime significantly increases overnight hypoglycemia risk (delayed lows).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Insulin timing considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Avoid exercising during insulin peak:</strong> Rapid-acting insulin peaks 1-2 hours after injection. If possible, exercise before meals or 3+ hours after meals.</li>
<li><strong>Exception:</strong> Post-meal walks (15-30 min) are safe and beneficial for reducing post-meal spikes—just monitor closely.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Special consideration for morning exercisers:</strong> If you exercise fasted (before breakfast), reduce overnight insulin the night before to prevent "stacking" of insulin effects.</p>
<h3>Strategy #7: Follow the 15-15 Rule for Treating Lows</h3>
<p><strong>If hypoglycemia occurs during exercise, proper treatment is critical.</strong> The 15-15 rule is the gold standard endorsed by the ADA:</p>
<p><strong>The 15-15 Rule:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Stop exercise immediately</strong> when blood sugar is below 70 mg/dL or symptoms appear.</li>
<li><strong>Consume 15 grams of fast-acting carbs</strong> (4 glucose tablets, 4 oz juice, or 1 tbsp honey).</li>
<li><strong>Wait 15 minutes</strong> without resuming activity.</li>
<li><strong>Recheck blood sugar.</strong></li>
<li><strong>If still below 70 mg/dL:</strong> Repeat steps 2-4.</li>
<li><strong>If above 70 mg/dL:</strong> Eat a balanced snack with carbs + protein (e.g., crackers with cheese) to stabilize levels before resuming exercise.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>⚠️ Do NOT:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Overcorrect with large amounts of carbs (causes rebound hyperglycemia)</li>
<li>Resume exercise until blood sugar is above 100 mg/dL and stable</li>
<li>Continue exercising while treating hypoglycemia (makes treatment less effective)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Strategy #8: Prevent Delayed (Nocturnal) Hypoglycemia</h3>
<p><strong>The most dangerous hypos happen 6-15 hours after exercise—often while you're asleep.</strong> This is because muscles continue pulling glucose from your blood to replenish glycogen stores long after your workout ends.</p>
<p><strong>Prevention strategies for delayed hypoglycemia:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Post-workout snack:</strong> Within 30 minutes of finishing exercise, eat 15-30g carbs + 10-15g protein. Example: chocolate milk, protein bar, or turkey sandwich.</li>
<li><strong>Reduce bedtime insulin:</strong> On exercise days, reduce long-acting insulin by 10-30% (with doctor approval). For insulin pumps, reduce overnight basal by 20-30%.</li>
<li><strong>Check blood sugar before bed:</strong> Aim for 120-180 mg/dL at bedtime on exercise days. If below 120 mg/dL, eat a bedtime snack with slow-digesting carbs (whole grain crackers, cheese).</li>
<li><strong>Set a 3 AM alarm after intense workouts:</strong> Check blood sugar mid-sleep if you've done prolonged or intense exercise (&gt;60 min moderate, or any high-intensity workout).</li>
<li><strong>CGM low alert:</strong> Set overnight low alert at 80 mg/dL (instead of 70 mg/dL) to wake you earlier if dropping.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Research insight:</strong> A 2022 study in <em>Diabetes Technology &amp; Therapeutics</em> found that consuming a bedtime snack with 25g carbs + 10g protein reduced nocturnal hypoglycemia by 67% after afternoon exercise.</p>

<strong>The transformation is real:</strong> Six months after implementing these strategies, Deepti hasn't had a single exercise-induced hypo. She now walks 45 minutes every morning, started strength training twice a week, and even completed a 5K charity run. "I went from being terrified of exercise to looking forward to it," she says. "The lawn incident feels like a lifetime ago."

<!-- Section 5: Emergency Protocol -->
<section id="emergency-protocol" style="margin-top: 3rem;">
<h2>Emergency Treatment Protocol for Severe Hypoglycemia</h2>
<p><strong>Severe hypoglycemia (below 54 mg/dL or inability to self-treat) is a medical emergency.</strong> Here's what to do:</p>
<h3>For Mild-Moderate Hypoglycemia (54-69 mg/dL, conscious, can swallow)</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Stop exercise immediately</strong> and sit down in a safe location.</li>
<li><strong>Follow 15-15 rule:</strong> Consume 15g fast-acting carbs, wait 15 min, recheck.</li>
<li><strong>Do not drive or operate machinery</strong> until blood sugar is above 80 mg/dL and stable.</li>
<li><strong>Inform someone nearby</strong> that you're treating low blood sugar and may need help.</li>
</ol>
<h3>For Severe Hypoglycemia (&lt;54 mg/dL or symptoms of confusion/inability to swallow)</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Call for help immediately.</strong> Do not attempt to walk or drive.</li>
<li><strong>If conscious and can swallow:</strong> Consume 30g fast-acting carbs (double dose), then follow 15-15 rule.</li>
<li><strong>If confused or unable to swallow:</strong> Use glucagon injection or nasal glucagon (someone else must administer). Call emergency services.</li>
<li><strong>After glucagon use:</strong> Blood sugar will rise within 10-15 minutes. Eat a meal with 30-45g carbs + protein once able to swallow to prevent rebound low.</li>
<li><strong>Seek medical attention</strong> even if you recover—severe hypoglycemia requires follow-up.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Glucagon Emergency Kit</h3>
<p><strong>Every person with diabetes on insulin should have glucagon available.</strong> Options include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Baqsimi (nasal glucagon):</strong> Easiest to administer (single-dose nasal spray, no injection). Cost: ~$300-400 (may be covered by insurance).</li>
<li><strong>Gvoke HypoPen (pre-filled injection):</strong> Auto-injector, no mixing required. Cost: ~$300-400.</li>
<li><strong>Glucagon Emergency Kit (traditional):</strong> Requires mixing powder and liquid, then injecting. Cost: ~$200-300.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Train family members, workout partners, or gym staff on how to use your glucagon kit. Severe hypoglycemia can impair your ability to self-administer.</p>
</section>
<!-- Section 6: Tracking Patterns -->
<section id="tracking" style="margin-top: 3rem;">
<h2>Tracking Your Personal Exercise-Glucose Patterns</h2>
<p><strong>The most effective prevention strategy is understanding YOUR unique glucose response to exercise.</strong> Everyone's body reacts differently based on fitness level, insulin sensitivity, medication regimen, and exercise type.</p>
<h3>What to Track in Your Exercise Log</h3>
<p>For 2-4 weeks, record the following for every workout:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pre-workout glucose</strong> (15 min before starting)</li>
<li><strong>Exercise type, intensity, and duration</strong> (e.g., "moderate cycling, 45 min")</li>
<li><strong>Time of day</strong> and time since last meal/insulin</li>
<li><strong>Carbs consumed before/during exercise</strong> (with amounts)</li>
<li><strong>Insulin adjustments made</strong> (if any)</li>
<li><strong>Mid-workout glucose</strong> (if &gt;60 min workout)</li>
<li><strong>Post-workout glucose</strong> (immediately after, 2 hours later, 6 hours later)</li>
<li><strong>Any hypoglycemia symptoms</strong> (even mild ones)</li>
<li><strong>How you felt</strong> during and after exercise (energy level, fatigue)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Analyze Your Patterns to Find Trends</h3>
<p>After 2-4 weeks of tracking, look for patterns:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What's your average glucose drop per hour of exercise?</strong> (e.g., "I drop 40-50 mg/dL per hour of running")</li>
<li><strong>What pre-workout glucose level keeps you safest?</strong> (many find 140-160 mg/dL works best)</li>
<li><strong>Which exercise types cause the steepest drops?</strong> (cardio usually drops faster than strength training)</li>
<li><strong>When do delayed lows typically occur?</strong> (e.g., "always 8-10 hours after long runs")</li>
<li><strong>Which pre-workout snacks work best?</strong> (stable energy without spikes)</li>
</ul>
<div style="background: #dbeafe; border-left: 4px solid #3b82f6; padding: 1rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;">
<strong>🔄 But here's what most people miss:</strong> A 2022 study found that 62% of people who experienced exercise-induced hypoglycemia blamed the exercise itself—but analysis showed the real culprit was often what happened 4-6 hours BEFORE the workout (missed snack, higher-than-usual insulin dose, poor sleep the night before). The exercise just exposed existing vulnerability. This is why single-data tracking (just glucose during workouts) misses the root cause. Multi-factor correlation—looking at sleep, stress, food timing, and insulin together—predicts hypo risk far more accurately than glucose alone. (<a href="https://doi.org/10.2337/dc21-2023" rel="noopener" style="color: #2563eb;" target="_blank">DOI: 10.2337/dc21-2023</a>)

<h3>How My Health Gheware™ Automates This Tracking</h3>
<p><strong>Manual logging is tedious and error-prone.</strong> My Health Gheware™ automates exercise-glucose correlation by:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Connecting to Strava and Google Fit</strong> to automatically import your workouts (type, duration, intensity, heart rate).</li>
<li><strong>Importing CGM data or manual glucose logs</strong> to map glucose changes before, during, and after each workout.</li>
<li><strong>Analyzing multi-data correlations</strong>—not just exercise, but also sleep quality, meal timing, and stress levels that affect your glucose response.</li>
<li><strong>Generating AI-powered insights in 10 minutes</strong> that identify patterns like: "Your glucose drops 35% faster during morning runs vs evening runs" or "You have a 78% risk of delayed hypo 6-8 hours after cycling &gt;60 min."</li>
<li><strong>Providing personalized recommendations</strong> for pre-workout carbs, insulin adjustments, and post-workout protocols based on YOUR data—not generic guidelines.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example insight from My Health Gheware™:</strong></p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #3b82f6; padding-left: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0; color: #475569; font-style: italic;">
          "Analysis of your last 14 workouts shows: When you run for 45+ minutes in the morning (before 9 AM), your glucose drops by an average of 68 mg/dL during the workout and experiences delayed lows (below 70 mg/dL) 7-9 hours later in 71% of cases. Recommendation: Reduce morning insulin by 40% on run days and consume a 25g carb + 15g protein snack immediately post-run."

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div style="margin-top: 2rem;">
<h3 style="color: #1e293b; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">What blood sugar level is safe to start exercising?</h3>
<p style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">The safe blood sugar range for exercise is <strong>100-250 mg/dL</strong>. Below 100 mg/dL, consume 15-30g of fast-acting carbs and wait 15 minutes before starting. Above 250 mg/dL with ketones present, skip exercise and consult your doctor. The ideal pre-workout glucose is <strong>120-180 mg/dL</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div style="margin-top: 2rem;">
<h3 style="color: #1e293b; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">How much should I reduce my insulin before exercise?</h3>
<p style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">For moderate exercise lasting 30-60 minutes, reduce rapid-acting insulin by <strong>25-50%</strong> for the meal before exercise. For intense or prolonged exercise, reduce by <strong>50-75%</strong>. Always consult your healthcare provider before adjusting insulin doses, as individual needs vary significantly.</p>
</div>
<div style="margin-top: 2rem;">
<h3 style="color: #1e293b; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">What should I eat before a workout to prevent low blood sugar?</h3>
<p style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">Eat a balanced snack with <strong>15-30g carbs plus protein</strong> 1-2 hours before exercise. Good options include: apple with peanut butter (20g carbs), Greek yogurt with berries (25g carbs), whole grain toast with egg (20g carbs), or banana with almonds (27g carbs). This provides sustained energy without spiking blood sugar.</p>
</div>
<div style="margin-top: 2rem;">
<h3 style="color: #1e293b; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">How often should I check blood sugar during exercise?</h3>
<p style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">Check blood sugar <strong>before exercise</strong>, every <strong>30 minutes during prolonged exercise</strong> (over 60 minutes), and <strong>immediately after finishing</strong>. For high-intensity workouts, check every 15-20 minutes. If using CGM, set alerts for &lt;80 mg/dL to catch dropping glucose early.</p>
</div>
<div style="margin-top: 2rem;">
<h3 style="color: #1e293b; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Can exercise cause delayed hypoglycemia?</h3>
<p style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">Yes. Delayed hypoglycemia can occur <strong>6-15 hours after intense or prolonged exercise</strong> as muscles replenish glycogen stores. To prevent this: eat a carb+protein snack after workouts, reduce bedtime insulin by 20-30% on exercise days, and check blood sugar before bed. Consider setting a 3 AM alarm after especially intense workouts.</p>
</div>
<div style="margin-top: 2rem;">
<h3 style="color: #1e293b; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">What are the warning signs of hypoglycemia during exercise?</h3>
<p style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">Exercise-induced hypoglycemia symptoms include: shakiness, rapid heartbeat, sweating (beyond normal workout sweat), dizziness, confusion, sudden weakness, blurred vision, and difficulty coordinating movements. <strong>Stop exercising immediately</strong> if you experience any of these symptoms and check your blood sugar.</p>
</div>
<div style="margin-top: 2rem;">
<h3 style="color: #1e293b; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">What's the 15-15 rule for treating exercise-induced low blood sugar?</h3>
<p style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">The 15-15 rule: consume <strong>15 grams of fast-acting carbs</strong> (4 glucose tablets, 4 oz juice, or 1 tbsp honey), wait <strong>15 minutes</strong>, then recheck blood sugar. If still below 70 mg/dL, repeat. Once blood sugar is above 70 mg/dL, eat a balanced snack with protein to stabilize levels before resuming exercise.</p>
</div>
<div style="margin-top: 2rem;">
<h3 style="color: #1e293b; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Should I exercise differently on insulin pump vs injections?</h3>
<p style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">With insulin pumps, you can reduce basal rates by 30-50% starting 60-90 minutes before exercise, or disconnect for up to 1 hour during intense workouts (with permission from your healthcare team). With injections, plan timing more carefully since you can't reduce actively circulating insulin—focus on carb intake and exercise timing relative to insulin peaks.</p>
</div>
<div style="margin-top: 2rem;">
<h3 style="color: #1e293b; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">What foods should I avoid before exercise with diabetes?</h3>
<p style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">Avoid: high-fat foods (slow digestion, delayed glucose response), high-fiber foods immediately before (can cause GI distress), sugary drinks without protein (rapid spike then crash), and large meals (redirect blood flow from muscles). Stick to easily digestible carbs paired with protein for stable energy.</p>
</div>
<div style="margin-top: 2rem;">
<h3 style="color: #1e293b; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">How does exercise intensity affect hypoglycemia risk?</h3>
<p style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">Moderate steady-state exercise (walking, cycling) lowers blood sugar predictably—highest hypo risk. High-intensity exercise (sprints, HIIT) can initially raise blood sugar, then cause delayed lows 2-8 hours later. Resistance training has lower immediate hypo risk but increases insulin sensitivity for 24-48 hours. Adjust strategies based on workout type.</p>
