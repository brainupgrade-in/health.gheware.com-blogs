      <!-- Why Install Section -->
      <h2 id="why-install">Why Install Health Gheware Android App?</h2>

      <h3>The Problem with Most Health Apps</h3>
      <p>
        If you're managing diabetes, you've probably noticed a frustrating gap in available tools:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Health tracking apps</strong> track steps and sleep, but don't correlate with glucose data</li>
        <li><strong>Most CGM apps</strong> show glucose readings in isolation (no multi-data insights)</li>
        <li><strong>Manual analysis</strong> is time-consuming (hours of spreadsheet work)</li>
        <li><strong>No AI-powered insights</strong> tailored to your specific patterns</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You end up with <em>data everywhere</em>, but <strong>insights nowhere</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>What Makes Health Gheware Different</h3>
      <p>
        My Health Gheware bridges this gap by becoming your <strong>all-in-one diabetes intelligence platform</strong>:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>🔗 Multi-Data Correlation:</strong> Combines glucose + sleep + activity + nutrition in one dashboard</li>
        <li><strong>🤖 AI-Powered Insights:</strong> Claude AI analyzes your data in 10 minutes (not weeks of manual work)</li>
        <li><strong>💡 Actionable Insights:</strong> 5-7 specific steps to improve your health (not generic advice)</li>
        <li><strong>😴 Sleep-Glucose Analysis:</strong> See exactly how sleep quality affects your blood sugar</li>
        <li><strong>📊 Time in Range (TIR) Tracking:</strong> The #1 diabetes control metric, calculated automatically</li>
        <li><strong>✉️ Email Reports:</strong> Share comprehensive insights with your doctor instantly</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why Download Now?</h3>
      <p>
        Don't wait for Google Play Store approval. Here's why you should install today:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>✅ <strong>Start tracking immediately</strong> (every day of data helps AI understand your patterns)</li>
        <li>✅ <strong>Get ₹500 free signup balance</strong> (5 comprehensive AI insights to test all features)</li>
        <li>✅ <strong>100% safe and secure APK</strong> from our official source (digitally signed)</li>
        <li>✅ <strong>Same features as upcoming Play Store version</strong> (no compromise)</li>
        <li>✅ <strong>Early access to updates</strong> (we're constantly improving based on user feedback)</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="definition-box">
        <h4>💡 What is an APK?</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>APK</strong> stands for <em>Android Package Kit</em>. It's the file format Android uses to install apps, similar to <code>.exe</code> files on Windows. Downloading an APK from a trusted source (like our official website) is completely safe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Think of it like installing software from a company's official website instead of a software marketplace—perfectly normal and secure when done right.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Comparison Section -->
      <h2 id="comparison">How Health Gheware Works with Google Health Connect</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Important Update:</strong> Google Fit is being phased out in 2026. <strong>Google Health Connect</strong> is the replacement platform that acts as a secure bridge between your health devices and apps like My Health Gheware.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here's how the integration works and what makes Health Gheware essential for diabetes management:

        Follow these 4 simple steps to install My Health Gheware Android app safely:
      </p>

      <h3>Step 1: Download the APK</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Open your Android browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)</li>
        <li>Go to: <strong><code>https://health.gheware.com/downloads/MyHealthGheware-v1.0.0-production.apk</code></strong></li>
        <li>The download will start automatically (file size: approximately 15-20 MB)</li>
        <li>Wait for the download to complete (notification bar will show progress)</li>
      </ol>

      <div class="definition-box" style="background: #fff5f5; border-left: 4px solid #ef4444;">
        <h4>⚠️ Important Security Note</h4>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
          <strong>Only download the APK from our official website:</strong><br>
          <code>https://health.gheware.com/downloads/</code>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
          <strong>Never download Health Gheware APK from:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
          <li>Third-party app stores or websites</li>
          <li>Forums, social media, or messaging apps</li>
          <li>File-sharing sites</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
          This is the <strong>ONLY official source</strong>. All our APKs are digitally signed and scanned for security.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>Step 2: Enable "Unknown Sources" (Security Settings)</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>Why This is Needed:</strong> By default, Android blocks app installations from sources other than the Google Play Store. You need to temporarily allow this for our official APK.
      </p>

      <h4>Instructions for Android 8.0+ (Most Devices):</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Go to <strong>Settings → Security & Privacy</strong></li>
        <li>Find <strong>Install Unknown Apps</strong> (or "Install apps from unknown sources")</li>
        <li>Select your <strong>browser</strong> (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)</li>
        <li>Toggle <strong>Allow from this source</strong> ON</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Instructions for Android 7.0 and Below:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Go to <strong>Settings → Security</strong></li>
        <li>Enable <strong>Unknown Sources</strong> (toggle ON)</li>
        <li>Confirm the security warning by tapping "OK"</li>
      </ol>

      <div class="soft-cta">
        <p style="margin: 0;">
          <strong>🔒 Security Tip:</strong> After installing Health Gheware, you can turn this setting back OFF for added security. You only need it enabled during installation.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>Step 3: Install the App</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Open your <strong>Downloads</strong> folder (or tap the download notification)</li>
        <li>Tap on <strong>MyHealthGheware-v1.0.0-production.apk</strong></li>
        <li>Android will show "Do you want to install this application?"</li>
        <li>Tap <strong>Install</strong></li>
        <li>Wait 10-15 seconds for installation to complete</li>
        <li>Tap <strong>Open</strong> to launch the app immediately</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>App Permissions</h4>
      <p>
        Health Gheware will request the following permissions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>📱 <strong>Internet Access:</strong> For AI analysis and data synchronization</li>
        <li>📊 <strong>Storage:</strong> To save glucose and health data locally on your device</li>
        <li>🔔 <strong>Notifications:</strong> For glucose alerts (optional, but recommended)</li>
        <li>🏥 <strong>Health Connect Access:</strong> To read sleep, activity, and heart rate data (optional)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        All permissions are required <strong>only for core app functionality</strong>. We never access personal data unrelated to health tracking.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 4: Re-Secure Your Device (Important!)</h3>

      <p>
        Now that Health Gheware is installed, let's re-secure your device:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Go back to <strong>Settings → Security & Privacy</strong></li>
        <li>Find <strong>Install Unknown Apps</strong></li>
        <li>Select your browser</li>
        <li>Toggle <strong>Allow from this source</strong> OFF</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        <strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Leaving "Unknown Sources" enabled can make your device vulnerable to malicious apps. Since Health Gheware is now installed, there's no need to keep this setting on.
      </p>

          <strong>💚 Real Example:</strong> When Rajesh first installed the Android app on his phone, he was skeptical it would tell him anything his CGM app didn't. "Within a week, the AI showed me something Dexcom Clarity never mentioned: my afternoon slump around 3 PM wasn't from lunch—it was from the previous night's sleep. On nights I got less than 6 hours, my 3 PM reading averaged 35 mg/dL higher." That single insight led him to prioritize sleep, and his overall TIR improved from 62% to 71% in just three weeks.

          <strong>🔄 But here's what most people miss:</strong> Installing a health app is the easy part—the challenge is actually opening it regularly. A 2024 behavioral analysis found that diabetes app users who set a specific daily time to check their data (like "right after breakfast") had 3.2× higher engagement rates than those who opened apps "whenever." The ones who improved their glucose control weren't the most tech-savvy—they were the ones who built a 2-minute daily habit around reviewing their data.

      <!-- FAQs Section -->
      <h2 id="faqs">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>

      <h3>Q1: Is it safe to install apps from outside the Google Play Store?</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> Yes, <strong>IF you download from the official source</strong>. Only download the Health Gheware APK from our official website: <code>https://health.gheware.com/downloads/</code>. We digitally sign all APKs and scan them for security. Never download from third-party sites, forums, or app stores. This is the ONLY official source.
      </p>

      <h3>Q2: When will Health Gheware be available on the Google Play Store?</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> We've submitted to Google Play and are currently in the review process. While we're working through Google's verification (especially around our business name approval), we're offering direct APK downloads so you can start managing your diabetes today. Once approved, you'll be able to update seamlessly through the Play Store.
      </p>

      <h3>Q3: Will my data transfer if I switch from APK to Play Store version?</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> Yes, 100%. Your account, glucose data, AI insights, and ₹500 free balance will automatically transfer. Just log in with the same email/Google account when the Play Store version is available.
      </p>

      <h3>Q4: Does the Android app have all the features of the web version?</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> Yes! The Android app has feature parity with the web version at <a href="https://health.gheware.com">https://health.gheware.com</a>, plus native Android benefits like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ Push notifications for glucose alerts</li>
        <li>✅ Google Health Connect integration (automatic sleep/activity sync from any device app)</li>
        <li>✅ Offline data entry (syncs when online)</li>
        <li>✅ Faster performance and smoother UI</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Q5: Do I need a CGM device to use Health Gheware?</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> No! While Health Gheware works best with CGM data (Dexcom, FreeStyle Libre), you can also:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ Manually enter blood glucose readings (fingerstick tests from glucose meters)</li>
        <li>✅ Import CSV files from glucometers</li>
        <li>✅ Track sleep and activity without glucose data (for general health monitoring)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        However, AI insights require at least 3 days of glucose data (manual or CGM).
      </p>

      <h3>Q6: How is Health Gheware different from my CGM app?</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> Your CGM app (Dexcom, FreeStyle Libre) shows <strong>WHAT</strong> your glucose is doing. Health Gheware shows <strong>WHY</strong> it's happening and <strong>WHAT to do</strong> about it by correlating glucose with sleep, activity, and meals. Think of it as your CGM app + Google Fit + AI nutritionist in one platform.

      </p>

      <h3>Q7: Can I use Health Gheware without Google Health Connect?</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> Yes, but you'll miss out on automatic sleep and activity tracking. Without Google Health Connect:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ You can still track glucose (CGM or manual)</li>
        <li>✅ You can still log meals</li>
        <li>✅ You can still get AI insights</li>
        <li>❌ You'll need to manually enter sleep data</li>
        <li>❌ Activity tracking won't be automatic</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Recommendation:</strong> Install Google Health Connect (free) and connect your device companion app (Samsung Health, Fitbit, etc.) for the best experience and most accurate insights.
      </p>

      <h3>Q8: How much does Health Gheware cost after the ₹500 free balance?</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> You have 3 options:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Subscription:</strong> ₹1,490/month (unlimited AI insights) - Best if you use it 2+ times per week</li>
        <li><strong>Pay-Per-Use:</strong> ₹20-100 per insight (top up balance anytime) - Best for occasional users</li>
        <li><strong>Free:</strong> If you only need manual tracking without AI insights, the app remains free forever</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Most users choose the subscription after their free trial ends because it's the most cost-effective for regular diabetes management.
      </p>

      <h3>Q9: Is my health data private and secure?</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> Absolutely. We follow industry best practices:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>🔒 <strong>Encryption:</strong> All data encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256)</li>
        <li>🚫 <strong>No Data Selling:</strong> We NEVER sell or share your health data with third parties</li>
        <li>🇮🇳 <strong>India-Hosted:</strong> Data stored on AWS Mumbai (ap-south-1) servers</li>
