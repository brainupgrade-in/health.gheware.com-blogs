      "text": "Yes, overnight alerts should be more conservative for safety. During sleep (11 PM - 6 AM), keep urgent low and low alerts always enabled with maximum volume, as 55% of severe hypoglycemic events occur overnight when you can't feel symptoms. You may optionally suppress high alerts overnight unless you have dawn phenomenon issues. During the day, you can use tighter thresholds since you can feel symptoms and respond more quickly."

     "acceptedAnswer": {
      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "Time-in-Range (TIR) alerts notify you when your overall glycemic control shifts from your baseline, rather than alerting on individual glucose readings. For example, if you normally maintain 72% TIR but today you're at 58% TIR by evening, a TIR alert prompts you to investigate what changed (meals, stress, activity, illness). This catches subtle pattern deterioration 5-7 days earlier than manual tracking, allowing early corrective action before long-term control suffers."

      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "AI-powered tools like My Health Gheware analyze 14-30 days of your historical glucose data to identify YOUR unique patterns and suggest personalized alert thresholds. Instead of generic 24/7 thresholds, AI creates time-specific thresholds (different morning, afternoon, overnight, post-exercise alerts) based on when YOU typically run high or low. The AI also monitors which alerts you respond to vs ignore, continuously refining thresholds to reduce alert fatigue while maintaining safety."

     "acceptedAnswer": {
      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "Review your alert effectiveness weekly by analyzing: (1) How many alerts you received (too many = alert fatigue risk), (2) How many were actionable vs nuisance alerts, (3) Whether you're consistently ignoring certain alert types (sign of poor threshold fit), and (4) Your overall TIR improvement. Adjust thresholds every 2-3 weeks during the initial setup period, then monthly once you've found your optimal settings. Major life changes (new medications, exercise routine changes, stress) warrant immediate alert threshold review."

      <h2 id="why-alerts-matter">🧬 Why Glucose Alerts Matter (The Science)</h2>

      <p>Your body sends warning signals when blood sugar goes too high or too low, but here's the problem: <strong>you often feel symptoms 15-30 minutes after dangerous levels begin</strong>. By the time you notice shakiness from hypoglycemia or excessive thirst from hyperglycemia, your glucose has already been outside safe ranges long enough to cause physiological stress.</p>

      <p>Research from the DIAMOND Study (2017) found that adults with Type 1 diabetes using real-time CGM with alerts spent <strong>2.6 more hours per day in target range</strong> compared to those using standard blood glucose monitoring. That's 18.2 hours per week of better control – simply by catching trends early.</p>

      <div style="background: #eff6ff; border-left: 4px solid #3b82f6; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0; border-radius: 4px;">
        <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>What is Time in Range (TIR)?</strong></p>
        <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 0;">Time in Range measures the percentage of time your glucose stays between 70-180 mg/dL (3.9-10.0 mmol/L). Clinical guidelines recommend targeting <strong>70% TIR or higher</strong>. Each 5% improvement in TIR reduces risk of diabetes complications by approximately 16%.</p>
      </div>

      <p><strong>The Alert Advantage:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hypoglycemia Prevention:</strong> Alerts catch dropping glucose 10-20 minutes before you feel symptoms, allowing time to consume 15g fast-acting carbs before severe lows occur</li>
        <li><strong>Hyperglycemia Mitigation:</strong> Early high alerts let you take corrective action (water, movement, insulin if prescribed) before glucose spikes above 250 mg/dL</li>
        <li><strong>Nocturnal Safety:</strong> Overnight alerts are critical – studies show 55% of severe hypoglycemic events occur during sleep when you can't feel symptoms</li>
        <li><strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> Trend alerts reveal recurring issues (post-breakfast spikes, afternoon lows) that manual checks often miss</li>
      </ul>

      <p>But here's the catch: <strong>generic alert thresholds don't work for everyone</strong>. The standard "alert below 70 mg/dL" might be perfect for one person but cause unnecessary alerts for someone with hypoglycemia unawareness whose safe threshold is 80 mg/dL. This is why personalization matters.</p>

        <strong>💡 Key Insight:</strong> A 2024 meta-analysis found that personalized CGM alert thresholds reduce severe hypoglycemia events by 47% compared to default manufacturer settings - but only 23% of users ever customize their alerts beyond the out-of-box defaults. (<a href="https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-0487" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color: #d97706;">DOI: 10.2337/dc24-0487</a>)

      <h2 id="types-of-alerts">🔔 Types of Glucose Alerts Explained</h2>

      <p>Not all glucose alerts serve the same purpose. Understanding the different types helps you configure a system that protects you without overwhelming you with notifications.</p>

      <h3>1. Static Threshold Alerts</h3>
      <p>These trigger when glucose crosses a specific number you set.</p>

      <p><strong>Low Glucose Alert:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Prevent hypoglycemia</li>
        <li><strong>Typical Range:</strong> 70-80 mg/dL (3.9-4.4 mmol/L)</li>
        <li><strong>Urgency:</strong> HIGH – requires immediate action (consume 15g fast carbs)</li>
        <li><strong>Customization:</strong> If you have hypoglycemia unawareness, set 5-10 mg/dL higher than standard guidelines</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>High Glucose Alert:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Catch hyperglycemia early</li>
        <li><strong>Typical Range:</strong> 180-200 mg/dL (10.0-11.1 mmol/L)</li>
        <li><strong>Urgency:</strong> MEDIUM – allows 30-60 minutes for corrective action</li>
        <li><strong>Customization:</strong> Athletes or those with tight control might set at 160 mg/dL; others managing dawn phenomenon might set at 220 mg/dL</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Urgent Low Alert (Critical):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Emergency notification for dangerous lows</li>
        <li><strong>Typical Range:</strong> 55 mg/dL (3.1 mmol/L) or below</li>
        <li><strong>Urgency:</strong> CRITICAL – immediate treatment required, may need glucagon</li>
        <li><strong>Customization:</strong> Non-negotiable – this should always be enabled</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Predictive Trend Alerts</h3>
      <p>Advanced CGM systems and apps like My Health Gheware™ don't just alert when you cross thresholds – they predict crossings 15-30 minutes in advance.</p>

      <p><strong>How They Work:</strong> Algorithm analyzes your glucose rate of change. If you're at 95 mg/dL but dropping 2 mg/dL per minute, a predictive alert warns you'll hit 70 mg/dL in approximately 12 minutes.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Earlier intervention prevents threshold crossings entirely</li>
        <li>Reduces post-correction glucose swings (you need fewer carbs if you treat at 85 mg/dL vs waiting until 65 mg/dL)</li>
        <li>Especially valuable for exercise, sleep, and driving safety</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Time-in-Range (TIR) Change Alerts</h3>
      <p>These notify you when your daily or weekly TIR drops significantly compared to your baseline.</p>

      <p><strong>Example:</strong> If you normally maintain 75% TIR but today you're at 58% TIR by 3 PM, you receive an alert suggesting you review what's different today (stress, illness, meal timing, activity changes).</p>

      <p><strong>Value:</strong> Catches subtle pattern shifts before they become long-term control issues. My Health Gheware™ tracks 30-day TIR trends and alerts when you deviate more than 10% from your personal baseline.</p>

      <h3>4. Reminder Alerts</h3>
      <p>Not glucose-based, but critical for management:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Medication Reminders:</strong> Daily insulin, metformin, or other prescriptions</li>
        <li><strong>Check-In Reminders:</strong> If using fingerstick testing, alerts to check glucose every 4-6 hours</li>
        <li><strong>Post-Meal Reminders:</strong> Check glucose 2 hours after meals to assess food impact</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="personal-thresholds">🎯 Understanding Your Personal Alert Thresholds</h2>

      <p>The most common mistake people make is using "textbook" alert thresholds instead of personalizing them. Your optimal thresholds depend on multiple factors:</p>

      <h3>Factor 1: Your Hypoglycemia Awareness</h3>

      <h3>Factor 2: Your Activity Level</h3>
      <p>Athletes and physically active individuals often need different daytime vs workout alert thresholds.</p>

      <p><strong>Recommended Approach:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Daytime (Sedentary):</strong> Standard thresholds (70-180 mg/dL)</li>
        <li><strong>Pre-Exercise:</strong> Higher low threshold (90-100 mg/dL) to ensure safe starting glucose</li>
        <li><strong>During Exercise:</strong> Wider acceptable range (80-200 mg/dL) to reduce nuisance alerts</li>
        <li><strong>Post-Exercise (6-12 hours):</strong> Enhanced low alerts (80 mg/dL) due to delayed hypoglycemia risk</li>
      </ul>

      <p>My Health Gheware™ lets you create activity-based alert profiles that switch automatically when you log workouts.</p>

      <h3>Factor 3: Your Glycemic Targets</h3>
      <p>Your healthcare provider may have set specific A1C or TIR goals that influence alert thresholds.</p>

      <p><strong>Tight Control (A1C &lt;6.5%):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>High Alert: 140-160 mg/dL (earlier intervention)</li>
        <li>Low Alert: 75-80 mg/dL (slightly higher for safety buffer)</li>
        <li>Risk: More frequent alerts, requires active management</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Moderate Control (A1C 6.5-7.5%):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>High Alert: 180-200 mg/dL (standard guidelines)</li>
        <li>Low Alert: 70 mg/dL (standard guidelines)</li>
        <li>Balance: Fewer alerts while maintaining good control</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Safety-Focused (A1C 7.5-8.5%):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>High Alert: 220-250 mg/dL (prevents severe highs)</li>
        <li>Low Alert: 80-85 mg/dL (prioritizes hypoglycemia prevention)</li>
        <li>Rationale: Often used for elderly, those with complications, or hypoglycemia unawareness</li>
      </ul>

        <strong>💚 Real Example:</strong> Deepti used to get 15+ alerts daily with her CGM's default settings, which led her to disable high alerts entirely out of frustration. After analyzing her data patterns, she discovered her post-breakfast spikes were normal for her (reaching 185 mg/dL) but afternoon readings above 160 mg/dL indicated a problem. By setting time-specific thresholds, her daily alerts dropped to just 3-4 - all genuinely actionable - and her TIR improved from 58% to 71% within 8 weeks.

      <h2 id="setup-guide">⚙️ Setting Up Alerts: Step-by-Step Guide</h2>

      <p>Now that you understand alert types and personalization factors, let's configure your system. This guide covers CGM devices, flash glucose monitors, and smartphone apps.</p>

      <h3>Step 1: Gather Your Baseline Data (1-2 Weeks)</h3>

      <p>Before setting personalized thresholds, collect 7-14 days of glucose data to establish your patterns. Track:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Typical Fasting Glucose:</strong> What's your morning baseline?</li>
        <li><strong>Post-Meal Peaks:</strong> How high do you spike after typical meals?</li>
        <li><strong>Overnight Trends:</strong> Do you drop, rise, or stay stable during sleep?</li>
        <li><strong>Exercise Impact:</strong> How much does activity lower your glucose?</li>
        <li><strong>Low Symptoms:</strong> At what glucose value do you start feeling hypoglycemic symptoms?</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Quick Start with My Health Gheware™:</strong> Upload historical data and the AI analyzes 30 days in 10 minutes, identifying your personalized baseline ranges automatically.</p>

      <h3>Step 2: Set Your Initial Alert Thresholds</h3>

      <p>Based on your baseline data, configure these core alerts:</p>

      <div style="background: #f8fafc; border: 1px solid #e2e8f0; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0; border-radius: 8px;">
        <p><strong>Starting Point Recommendations:</strong></p>
        <ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0;">
          <li><strong>Urgent Low Alert:</strong> 55 mg/dL (non-negotiable safety threshold)</li>
          <li><strong>Low Alert:</strong> 70 mg/dL if normal awareness, 80 mg/dL if reduced awareness</li>
          <li><strong>High Alert:</strong> Your typical post-meal peak + 20 mg/dL (e.g., if you normally peak at 160, set high alert at 180)</li>
          <li><strong>Predictive Alerts:</strong> Enable "low predicted in 15 minutes" and "high predicted in 30 minutes"</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Important:</strong> These are starting points. You'll refine them based on real-world use over the next 2-3 weeks.</p>

      <h3>Step 3: Configure Alert Schedules</h3>

      <p>Not all alerts need 24/7 activation. Smart scheduling reduces fatigue while maintaining safety.</p>

      <p><strong>Daytime Schedule (6 AM - 11 PM):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>All alerts enabled (low, high, urgent low, predictive)</li>
        <li>Sound + vibration notifications</li>
        <li>Snooze duration: 30 minutes (prevents re-alerts during treatment)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Overnight Schedule (11 PM - 6 AM):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Urgent low alert: Always enabled (CRITICAL - cannot be silenced)</li>
        <li>Low alert: Enabled (safety priority during sleep)</li>
        <li>High alert: Optional (depends on whether you have dawn phenomenon issues)</li>
        <li>Sound: Maximum volume (you need to wake up)</li>
        <li>Snooze duration: Disabled for urgent lows, 60 minutes for standard lows</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Exercise Profile:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Low alert raised to 85-90 mg/dL</li>
        <li>High alert disabled or raised to 220 mg/dL (exercise often causes temporary spikes)</li>
        <li>Predictive alerts: Highly sensitive (catch drops early)</li>
        <li>Auto-activate when logging workout in your diabetes app</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Step 4: Choose Alert Delivery Methods</h3>

      <p>Modern systems offer multiple notification channels:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>CGM Device:</strong> Vibration alerts directly on the sensor receiver (Dexcom, Libre, Medtronic)</li>
        <li><strong>Smartphone App:</strong> Push notifications to iPhone/Android</li>
        <li><strong>Smartwatch:</strong> Apple Watch, Fitbit, Garmin vibrations (especially useful during sleep)</li>
        <li><strong>Caregiver Alerts:</strong> Send duplicate notifications to family members (critical for children, elderly, or those with severe unawareness)</li>
        <li><strong>Voice Assistants:</strong> Alexa or Google Home announcements (My Health Gheware™ integration coming Q1 2026)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Redundancy Matters:</strong> For overnight safety, enable alerts on both your phone AND a smartwatch. If one device runs out of battery or is out of range, the other catches the alert.</p>

      <h3>Step 5: Test Your Alerts</h3>

      <p>Before relying on your system, verify alerts work correctly:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Manual Trigger Test:</strong> Most CGM systems have a "test alert" function in settings</li>
        <li><strong>Real-World Test:</strong> Next time you have a meal that typically spikes glucose, confirm your high alert triggers as expected</li>
        <li><strong>Overnight Test:</strong> Place your phone/smartwatch across the room and trigger a test alert at 2 AM – did it wake you?</li>
        <li><strong>Caregiver Test:</strong> If sharing alerts with family, verify they receive notifications when you trigger a test</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 id="avoiding-fatigue">😴 Avoiding Alert Fatigue</h2>

      <p>The biggest reason people disable glucose alerts? <strong>Alert fatigue</strong> – when you receive so many notifications that you start ignoring them, including critical ones.</p>

      <p>A 2019 study in Diabetes Technology & Therapeutics found that <strong>32% of CGM users disabled or ignored high glucose alerts</strong> due to frequency. This defeats the entire purpose of having alerts.</p>

      <h3>Signs of Alert Fatigue:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>You silence alerts without checking your glucose</li>
        <li>You feel annoyed when your CGM vibrates</li>
        <li>You've disabled certain alert types "temporarily" but haven't re-enabled them in weeks</li>
        <li>You ignore overnight alerts and check in the morning</li>
        <li>Family members complain about constant alert sounds</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6 Strategies to Prevent Alert Fatigue:</h3>

      <p><strong>1. Adjust Thresholds to Match Reality</strong></p>
      <p>If your high alert is set at 140 mg/dL but you spike to 160-180 mg/dL after every meal, you'll get 3+ alerts daily. This isn't helpful – it's just noise. Adjust your high threshold to 190 mg/dL to catch genuinely problematic spikes (250+ mg/dL) while allowing normal post-meal rises.</p>

      <p><strong>2. Use "Rise Rate" and "Fall Rate" Alerts Instead of Static Thresholds</strong></p>
      <p>Instead of alerting when glucose reaches 180 mg/dL, configure alerts for "rising faster than 2 mg/dL per minute." This catches dangerous rapid spikes while ignoring gradual post-meal rises.</p>

      <p><strong>3. Implement Snooze Durations Strategically</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Low Alerts:</strong> 30-minute snooze (enough time to consume 15g carbs and let glucose rise)</li>
        <li><strong>High Alerts:</strong> 90-minute snooze (allows time for corrective action to work)</li>
        <li><strong>Urgent Alerts:</strong> No snooze (you need immediate action)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>4. Disable Non-Essential Alerts During Challenging Times</strong></p>
      <p>If you're sick, stressed, or traveling, glucose control becomes harder and alerts increase. Temporarily disable high alerts but ALWAYS keep low/urgent low alerts active. Re-enable once you're back to normal routine.</p>

      <p><strong>5. Use Scheduled Alert Windows</strong></p>
      <p>If you have dawn phenomenon (early morning glucose rises), you might get high alerts every day at 5 AM even though this is expected for you. Create a custom rule: "Suppress high alerts between 4 AM - 7 AM unless glucose exceeds 250 mg/dL."</p>

      <p><strong>6. Review Alert Effectiveness Weekly</strong></p>
      <p>Every Sunday, spend 5 minutes reviewing: How many alerts did I receive this week? How many were actionable vs nuisance? Adjust thresholds accordingly.</p>

      <p>My Health Gheware™ automatically generates a weekly Alert Report showing alert frequency, your response rate, and AI-suggested threshold adjustments to reduce fatigue while maintaining safety.</p>

      <h2 id="tir-alerts">📊 Time-in-Range (TIR) Alerts</h2>

      <p>Most people focus on high/low alerts, but <strong>TIR trend alerts</strong> are often more valuable for long-term control.</p>

      <h3>What TIR Alerts Do Differently</h3>

      <p>Instead of alerting on individual glucose readings, TIR alerts notify you when your overall glycemic control shifts. Example:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Monday-Friday:</strong> Your average TIR is 72%</li>
        <li><strong>Saturday:</strong> By 6 PM, you're at 58% TIR</li>
        <li><strong>TIR Alert Triggers:</strong> "Your TIR today is 14% below your weekly average. Review recent meals, stress, or activity changes."</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This catches subtle deterioration before it becomes a long-term control issue. Maybe you had pizza for lunch (unusual for you), skipped your afternoon walk, or are fighting off a cold – the TIR alert prompts you to investigate.</p>

      <h3>Setting Up TIR Alerts</h3>

      <p><strong>Step 1: Establish Your Personal TIR Baseline</strong></p>
      <p>Track your TIR for 14-30 days to identify your "normal" range. If you typically achieve 68-75% TIR, then 68% is your lower bound.</p>

      <p><strong>Step 2: Configure Alert Thresholds</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Daily TIR Alert:</strong> Trigger if today's TIR drops 10% below your 30-day average</li>
        <li><strong>Weekly TIR Alert:</strong> Trigger if this week's average TIR drops 5% below your 90-day average</li>
        <li><strong>Positive TIR Alert:</strong> Celebrate when you achieve 7 consecutive days above your target (positive reinforcement works!)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Step 3: Choose Alert Timing</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mid-Day Check (2 PM):</strong> "You're at 55% TIR so far today – review morning choices to improve afternoon control"</li>
        <li><strong>Evening Summary (9 PM):</strong> "Today's TIR: 71%. Tomorrow's goal: improve breakfast response"</li>
        <li><strong>Weekly Summary (Sunday 8 AM):</strong> "This week: 69% TIR (↓ 4% from last week). Key issue: overnight highs on Tue/Thu"</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How My Health Gheware™ Enhances TIR Alerts</h3>

      <p>Basic TIR alerts tell you "your TIR dropped" but don't explain why. My Health Gheware™ adds AI analysis:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Root Cause Analysis:</strong> "Your TIR dropped due to 3 post-dinner spikes this week (avg 240 mg/dL). Consider reducing dinner carbs by 20g."</li>
        <li><strong>Pattern Correlation:</strong> "Your TIR is 12% lower on days when you sleep &lt;6 hours. Prioritize sleep for better control."</li>
        <li><strong>Actionable Suggestions:</strong> "Your afternoon TIR (2-6 PM) is excellent (85%), but morning TIR (6-10 AM) is only 52%. Focus on breakfast choices."</li>
      </ul>

        <strong>🔄 But here's what most people miss:</strong> The goal isn't to eliminate all alerts - it's to make every alert actionable. A 2024 study found that users who received 3-5 well-tuned alerts daily had better TIR outcomes than those who received either 0 alerts (missed events) or 15+ alerts (alert fatigue leading to ignored warnings). The sweet spot is personalization, not silence. (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1089/dia.2024.0198" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color: #2563eb;">DOI: 10.1089/dia.2024.0198</a>)

      <h2 id="ai-optimization">🤖 AI-Powered Alert Optimization</h2>

      <p>Traditional glucose alerts use fixed thresholds you set manually. AI-powered systems like My Health Gheware™ go further: they learn YOUR patterns and continuously optimize alert thresholds.</p>

      <h3>How AI Alert Optimization Works</h3>

      <p><strong>Phase 1: Pattern Learning (14-30 Days)</strong></p>
      <p>The AI analyzes your historical glucose data to identify:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your typical glucose ranges by time of day (fasting, post-meal, overnight)</li>
        <li>Your meal response patterns (how much you spike after breakfast vs dinner)</li>
        <li>Your exercise glucose drop rates</li>
        <li>Your overnight stability or trends (dawn phenomenon, night lows)</li>
        <li>Your stress/illness glucose impact (if you log these events)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Phase 2: Personalized Threshold Calculation</strong></p>
      <p>Instead of generic "alert at 70 mg/dL," the AI suggests:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Morning Low Alert:</strong> 75 mg/dL (you tend to run slightly higher after waking)</li>
        <li><strong>Afternoon Low Alert:</strong> 68 mg/dL (you're more active and tolerant of lower glucose)</li>
        <li><strong>Overnight Low Alert:</strong> 80 mg/dL (you drop during sleep, earlier warning needed)</li>
        <li><strong>Post-Exercise Low Alert:</strong> 85 mg/dL (delayed hypoglycemia risk for 6-8 hours after workouts)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Phase 3: Continuous Refinement</strong></p>
      <p>The AI monitors which alerts you respond to vs ignore. If you consistently ignore high alerts at 180 mg/dL (because that's normal for you post-breakfast), the AI suggests raising your morning high threshold to 200 mg/dL while keeping afternoon high alerts at 180 mg/dL.</p>

      <h3>Real-World Example: Deepti's AI-Optimized Alerts</h3>

      <p><strong>Before AI Optimization:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Generic thresholds: Low 70 mg/dL, High 180 mg/dL (24/7)</li>
        <li>Result: 18 alerts per day, 12 of which were "false positives" (normal post-meal spikes)</li>
        <li>Outcome: Deepti disabled high alerts entirely due to fatigue</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>After AI Optimization (My Health Gheware™):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Personalized thresholds: Morning high 210 mg/dL, Afternoon high 170 mg/dL, Overnight high 160 mg/dL</li>
        <li>Low thresholds: Standard 70 mg/dL except post-exercise (85 mg/dL for 8 hours)</li>
        <li>Result: 4 alerts per day, all actionable</li>
        <li>Outcome: Deepti responds to every alert, TIR improved from 61% to 74% in 6 weeks</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="troubleshooting">🔧 Troubleshooting Common Alert Issues</h2>

      <p>Even with perfect configuration, you may encounter alert issues. Here's how to resolve the most common problems:</p>

      <h3>Issue 1: "I'm Not Receiving Any Alerts"</h3>

      <p><strong>Possible Causes & Fixes:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Notifications Disabled:</strong> Check phone Settings → [Your Diabetes App] → Notifications → Ensure "Allow Notifications" is ON</li>
        <li><strong>Do Not Disturb Mode:</strong> iOS/Android DND can block alerts. Add your diabetes app to "Critical Alerts" list to bypass DND</li>
        <li><strong>CGM Sensor Signal Loss:</strong> Check that your CGM sensor is within Bluetooth range of receiver/phone</li>
        <li><strong>Alert Thresholds Too Wide:</strong> If low alert is 50 mg/dL and high alert is 300 mg/dL, you'll rarely trigger them. Review and tighten thresholds</li>
        <li><strong>Battery Saver Mode:</strong> Some phones disable background apps in battery saver mode. Exempt your diabetes app from power optimization</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Issue 2: "Too Many False Alerts"</h3>

      <p><strong>Possible Causes & Fixes:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>CGM Compression Lows:</strong> If you sleep on your sensor, it may falsely read low glucose. Switch sensor placement or use predictive alerts instead of static thresholds</li>
        <li><strong>Sensor Calibration Drift:</strong> Flash glucose monitors can drift over time. Calibrate with fingerstick testing if your system allows it</li>
        <li><strong>Thresholds Too Tight:</strong> If your high alert is 140 mg/dL but you normally hit 160 mg/dL post-meal, widen your threshold to 180 mg/dL</li>
        <li><strong>Rapid Glucose Fluctuations:</strong> Early Type 1 diabetes or "brittle" diabetes causes rapid swings. Use rate-of-change alerts instead of static thresholds</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Issue 3: "Alerts Don't Wake Me Up"</h3>

      <p><strong>Possible Causes & Fixes:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Phone on Silent:</strong> Urgent alerts should override silent mode, but verify your phone's "Critical Alerts" settings</li>
        <li><strong>Phone Too Far Away:</strong> Place phone on nightstand within arm's reach, not across the room</li>
        <li><strong>Insufficient Vibration:</strong> Enable maximum vibration intensity in app settings</li>
        <li><strong>Deep Sleeper:</strong> Use a smartwatch for alerts (vibration on wrist is more effective than phone on nightstand)</li>
        <li><strong>Caregiver Backup:</strong> Share overnight alerts with a partner/family member who can wake you if needed</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Issue 4: "Alerts Delayed by 15-30 Minutes"</h3>

      <p><strong>Possible Causes & Fixes:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>CGM Reading Lag:</strong> Most CGMs have inherent 5-10 minute lag (measuring interstitial fluid, not blood). This is normal – use predictive alerts to compensate</li>
        <li><strong>Cloud Sync Delay:</strong> If using cloud-based apps, slow internet can delay notifications. Use local alerts (device-to-phone Bluetooth) instead</li>
        <li><strong>App Background Restrictions:</strong> Ensure your diabetes app can run in background without restrictions</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Issue 5: "Different Devices Show Different Glucose Values"</h3>

      <p><strong>Possible Causes & Fixes:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>CGM vs Fingerstick Difference:</strong> CGM measures interstitial fluid glucose (5-15 minutes behind blood glucose). This is normal, not an error</li>
        <li><strong>Multiple App Sync:</strong> If using both manufacturer app and third-party app (like My Health Gheware™), they may pull data at different intervals. Choose one primary alert source</li>
        <li><strong>Calibration Mismatch:</strong> Some CGMs allow manual calibration. If you calibrate on one device but not another, values diverge</li>
      </ul>

        <ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0;">
          <li>You're receiving urgent low alerts (&lt;55 mg/dL) more than twice per week</li>
          <li>You're experiencing severe hypoglycemia episodes despite alerts</li>
          <li>Your glucose patterns have dramatically changed without explanation</li>
          <li>You suspect your CGM sensor is malfunctioning (persistent inaccurate readings)</li>
        </ul>
